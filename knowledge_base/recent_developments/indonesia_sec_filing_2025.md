## CERTAIN DEFINED TERMS AND CONVENTIONS

Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this report to “Rupiah”, “IDR” or “Rp” are to the currency of Indonesia, those to “dollars”, “U.S. dollars” or “U.S.$” are to the currency of the United States of America, those to “Euro” or “€” are to the currency of the European Union, those to “SDR” are to Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”) and those to “ID” are to Islamic Dinars of the Islamic Development Bank. References to “Indonesia” or the “Republic” are to the Republic of Indonesia, references to the “Government” are to the Government of Indonesia and references to “BI” are to Bank Indonesia.

In addition, unless otherwise indicated, all references in this report to (i) “tons” are to metric tons, each of which is equal to 1,000 kilograms or approximately 2,204.6 pounds, (ii) “barrels” are to U.S. barrels, each of which is equal to 159.0 liters, (iii) “LNG” are to liquefied natural gas and (iv) “LPG” are to liquefied petroleum gas. Measures of distance referred to herein are stated in kilometers or “km” each of which is equal to 1,000 meters or approximately 0.62 miles. Measures of area referred to herein are stated in square kilometers, each of which is equal to approximately 0.39 square miles, or in hectares, each of which is equal to approximately 2.47 acres.

The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources publishes an average monthly and annual price for Indonesian crude oil which is commonly referred to as the Indonesian Crude Price (the “ICP”). According to the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No. 29 of 2021 on the Procedure for Determination of Methodology, Price Formula, and Indonesian Crude Price, the determination of ICP can be based on 3 methods, namely benchmarking method, indexation method, and auction method. The Government evaluates the methodology of the calculation of the ICP from time to time and, if appropriate, adjusts the formula to ensure that the ICP closely tracks world market prices for Indonesian crude oil. The Government uses the ICP for various accounting and other purposes. For instance, the Ministry of Finance uses the ICP as an assumption underlying the preparation of the Government budget. See “Republic of Indonesia — Government Budget.”

Statistical information included in this report is the latest official data publicly available at the date hereof. Financial data provided in this report may be subsequently revised in accordance with Indonesia’s ongoing maintenance of its economic data. The Republic has no obligation to distribute such revised data to any holder of debt securities.

In August 2014, the Republic revised its methodology in compiling balance of payments data, using the sixth edition of Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (“BPM6”). This revised methodology was implemented to comply with international best practices. Indonesia’s balance of payments statistics generally follows the concepts and definitions outlined in BPM6 and, in particular, current accounts, and capital and financial accounts of the balance of payment statements are defined generally in accordance with BPM6.

In this report, gross domestic product (“GDP”) is shown in both current and constant market prices. GDP at current market prices value a country’s output using the actual prices for each year, while GDP at constant market prices (also referred to as “real” GDP) value output using the prices from a base year, thereby eliminating the distorting effects of inflation and deflation. In 2015, Statistics Indonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik (“BPS”)) adopted the calendar year 2010 as the base year (the “Base Year”) for the calculation of Indonesia’s GDP in constant market prices. Unless stated otherwise, all GDP growth rates in this report (in aggregate or by sector) are period-on-period comparisons based on constant market prices using the Base Year. Percentage shares of Indonesia’s GDP represented by various sectors (unless otherwise noted) use current market prices.

## PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION

For ease of presentation, certain financial information relating to the Republic included herein is presented as translated into U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specified herein, all translations of Rupiah into U.S. dollars or from U.S. dollars into Rupiah were made at the middle exchange rate, the mid- point between the buy and sell rates (the “BI middle exchange rate”), between the Rupiah and the U.S. dollar, as announced by Bank Indonesia, the Indonesian Central Bank, as of the respective dates to which such information relates. However, these translations should not be construed as a representation that the Rupiah amount actually represents such U.S. dollar amount or could be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate indicated or any other rate. In addition, unless otherwise specified herein, all translations of Rupiah into currencies other than U.S. dollars, or from such other currencies into Rupiah, were made at the BI middle exchange rate between the Rupiah and such other currencies as announced by Bank Indonesia as of the respective dates to which such information relates.

The following table sets forth information on exchange rates between the Rupiah and the U.S. dollar for and as of the end of the periods indicated.

Statistical Data

Unless otherwise indicated, all statistical data and figures for 2024 and 2025 or any part thereof are estimates based upon preliminary data and are subject to review and adjustment.

Certain budget figures appear as audited numbers in the relevant year’s Central Government Financial Report (Laporan Keuangan Pemerintah Pusat (“LKPP”)).

Certain statistical or financial information included in this report may differ from previously published information for a number of reasons, including basis of presentation and ongoing statistical revisions. Also, certain monetary amounts included in this report have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an exact arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not about historical facts, including statements about Indonesia’s beliefs and expectations. These statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections, and therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Some of the statements contained in this report under “Republic of Indonesia” are forward looking. They include statements concerning, among others:

 	•
the Republic’s economic, business and political conditions and prospects;

 	•
the Republic’s financial stability;

 	•
the depreciation or appreciation of the Rupiah;

 	•
changes in interest rates and inflation; and

 	•
governmental, statutory, regulatory or administrative initiatives.

The Republic undertakes no obligation to update publicly any of these statements in light of new information or future events, including changes in Indonesia’s economic policy or budgeted expenditures, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. The Republic cautions you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. These factors include, but are not limited to:

 	•
adverse external factors, such as high international interest rates and recession or low growth in the Republic’s trading partners. High international interest rates could increase the Republic’s current account deficit and budgetary expenditures. Recession or low growth in, or trade policies of, the Republic’s trading partners could lead to fewer exports from the Republic and, indirectly, lower growth in the Republic;

 	•
instability or volatility in the international financial markets. This could lead to domestic volatility, making it more difficult for the Government to achieve its macroeconomic goals. This could also lead to declines in foreign direct and portfolio investment inflows;

 	•
adverse domestic factors, such as a decline in domestic savings and investment, increases in domestic inflation, high domestic interest rates and exchange rate volatility. Each of these factors could lead to lower growth or lower international reserves; and

 	•
other adverse factors, such as adverse commodity price movements, climatic or seismic events, international or domestic hostilities, infectious disease outbreaks or pandemics, political uncertainty and delays in implementing and realizing infrastructure projects and economic policies.

Land and People

Area

Situated between Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south, the Republic of Indonesia covers a total land area of approximately 1,916,907 square km, comprising approximately 16,766 islands (the majority of which are uninhabited) and forming part of the world’s largest archipelago.

The main islands of Indonesia are Sumatera, Java, Bali, Kalimantan (also known as Borneo, the northern part of which belongs to Malaysia and Brunei), Sulawesi and Papua (the eastern part of which belongs to Papua New Guinea). Indonesia extends 5,120 km across the equator from Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam, or Aceh, in the west to Papua in the east. Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital and largest city, is located on the northern coast of the western part of Java.

Volcanic and Other Natural Disasters

Indonesia is located in one of the most volcanically and seismically active regions in the world. Because it is located in the convergence zone of three major lithospheric plates, it is subject to significant seismic activity that can lead to destructive volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis, or tidal waves, including the 2004 earthquake and subsequent Indian Ocean tsunami that devastated the Province of Aceh and the 2018 earthquake and subsequent tsunami that caused substantial loss of life and extensive infrastructure and property damage in Central Sulawesi. In addition to these geological events, Indonesia has also been struck by other natural disasters such as heavy rains and flooding. The central Government’s realization of contingency fund for financing post-natural disaster relief efforts was Rp3.0 trillion in 2020, Rp4.5 trillion in 2021, Rp2.5 trillion in 2022, Rp4.3 trillion in 2023 and Rp5.3 trillion in 2024. All of these natural disasters have resulted in loss of life, displacement of people and destruction of property, and could have significant economic and developmental effects.

Environment

Environmental problems confronting Indonesia include:

 	•
deforestation;

 	•
scarcity and quality of the water supply;

 	•
land subsidence;

 	•
soil erosion;

 	•
air pollution;

 	•
inadequate waste management in urban centers; and

 	•
land and forest fires.

Indonesia is also vulnerable to the impact of global climate change such as prolonged droughts, increased frequency of extreme weather events and heavy rainfall resulting in floods, that will, in turn, impact the production and distribution of food, water, and energy in various provinces or regencies across Indonesia. Therefore, Indonesia considers climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts as an integrated concept that is essential for building resilience in safeguarding food, water and energy resources. Indonesia has adopted the National Action Plan on Climate Change Adaptation, which provides a national framework for adaptation initiatives that has been mainstreamed into the National Development Plan. The medium-term goal of Indonesia’s climate change adaptation strategy is to reduce risks on all development sectors (agriculture, water, energy security, forestry, maritime and fisheries, health, public service, infrastructure, and urban system) by 2030 through local capacity strengthening, improved knowledge management, convergent policy on climate change adaptation and disaster risks reduction, and application of adaptive technology.

In recent years, the Government has implemented various measures to address haze and other adverse effects caused by forest and field fires related to land clearance for agriculture in the islands of Sumatera and Kalimantan. The Government seeks to address these and other environmental concerns through greater supervision and regulation, and community and private sector awareness and involvement.

In 2009, then President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono announced an emissions target that became the basis for Indonesia’s national climate change policy in 2015: a 26.0% reduction in greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions below business-as-usual by 2020 and up to 41.0% reduction by 2020 with international assistance. The Republic ratified the Paris Agreement on October 31, 2016, and published its nationally determined contribution (“NDC”) in November 2016, committing to a 29.0% reduction in GHG by 2030 and the same 41.0% conditional target by 2030. The Republic updated the NDC in September 2022, improving the targets to a 31.9% reduction in GHG and 43.2% conditional target with international support by 2030, in line with the Republic’s pledge made at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2060. The NDC, as updated, is consistent with Indonesia’s nationally determined contribution target as set out in Presidential Regulation No. 98 of 2021 on the Implementation of Carbon Economic Value to Achieve Nationally Determined Contribution Target and Control over Greenhouse Gas Emission Pertaining to National Development.

The Government is making efforts, including multilateral cooperation, to achieve these climate targets. At the G20 meeting in Bali in November 2022, Indonesia and a number of developed economies including Canada, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States issued a joint statement to launch a Just Energy Transition Partnership (“JETP”), pursuant to which the developed economies committed to provide, mobilize and facilitate funding in the form of grants, low interest loans, and investment, with U.S.$10 billion expected to come from public sectors and U.S.$10 billion from private investment, to support Indonesia’s transition to clean energy. In November 2023, Indonesia released for public consultation a draft of the investment roadmap to mobilize the U.S.$20 billion committed under JETP and accelerate the country’s transition toward clean energy. Under the roadmap, known as the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (“CIPP”), Indonesia is seeking to cut CO2 emissions from its on-grid power sector by 250 million tons by 2030 and to increase the portion of renewable energy in its power mix to 44% by 2030. CIPP outlines the need for U.S.$97.1 billion of further investment beyond the U.S.$20 billion committed under JETP, including U.S.$66.9 billion for 400 clean energy project proposals to be started by 2030 at the latest.

As part of its efforts to achieve the climate goals, the Government launched an emissions trading system for the power generation sector in February 2023. The trading system initially covered 99 coal-fired power plants, accounting for 81.4% of Indonesia’s national power generation capacity. These power plants are subject to Government-established emissions intensity targets, which determine the number of allowances allocated to each plant for every megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced. In September 2023, the Government also launched a carbon exchange, the Indonesia Carbon Exchange, or the IDX Carbon, operated by the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The IDX Carbon is designed to facilitate emissions trading and serve as a platform for future environmental commodities. In addition, the Government is working on implementing carbon tax, with its legal basis established under Law No. 7 of 2021 on the Harmonization of Tax Regulations. Revenue generated from carbon tax will be allocated to finance climate mitigation and adaptation projects, support investment in clean technology and energy efficiency, and strengthen social safety nets for vulnerable communities. Entities will be able to use carbon units obtained through the emissions trading system or offset mechanisms to reduce their carbon tax liability. The carbon tax is expected to be imposed initially on coal-fired power plants, with a gradual expansion to other sectors in subsequent phases.

On March 17, 2025, the Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs established an energy transition and green economy task force comprising 18 ministries to lead Indonesia’s cross-sectoral efforts to implement a just, inclusive, and measurable green transition, in line with the 2025–2029 National Medium-Term Development Plan and Indonesia’s commitments made during the G20 Leaders’ Summit. The Government has authorized the task force to develop roadmaps, evaluate existing regulations, and propose new policy instruments to accelerate renewable energy adoption, clean industrial technologies, and decarbonization pathways.

The Republic anticipates that its pursuit of these targets, in conjunction with the ongoing global transition towards sustainable energy and the climate commitments made by governments and the private sector, will, over time, lead to declines in demand for conventional sources of energy such as coal, oil, gas, and timber in the future. These anticipated declines are likely to result in lower export and domestic consumption, presenting challenges to the Republic’s sectors centered on these natural resources. The Government is proactively addressing these challenges by seeking to diversify the national economy and investing in sustainable energy sources through initiatives such as the following:

 	•
Investment in emerging sectors. The Republic is channeling investments into renewable energy sectors such as solar, wind and geothermal energy. For example, following the Government mandate stipulated in Indonesia’s Law 3/2022 (as amended by Law No. 21 of 2023) (as defined herein) and Presidential Regulation 63/2022, Nusantara must be powered by 100% renewable electricity and achieve net zero by 2045. The cultivation of these renewable energy industries is anticipated to yield economic benefits and stimulate job creation.

 	•
Developing value-added industries. The Republic has implemented policies to develop downstream manufacturing and refining industries that add value to the raw materials before export. This approach increases export value, creates jobs and stimulates domestic industrial growth. See “Economy and Gross Domestic Product — Principal Sectors of the Economy — Manufacturing Industry” for further information.

 	•
Expanding market access. The Republic is pursuing trade agreements and strengthening trade partnerships to open new market opportunities for export, including export of products other than natural resources. The Republic is currently carrying out negotiations on several bilateral preferential or free trade agreements, such as the Indonesia-EU Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement. See “Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments — Membership in International and Regional Free Trade Agreements” for more information.

 	•
Infrastructure improvements. Infrastructure development aims to enhance connectivity between different geographies, elevate economic productivity, drive urbanization, facilitate the movement of labor, foster equitable regional development and boost foreign and domestic investment. These goals, if achieved, will lay a solid foundation for Indonesia’s economic diversification.

These efforts are expected to help reduce the Republic’s reliance on a narrow spectrum of commodities and better grow its economy, while steadfastly advancing towards its climate objectives.

The Law on Job Creation (as defined in “— Labor and Employment — Law on Job Creation”) substantially revamped Indonesia’s environmental law that was enacted in 2009 by virtue of Law No. 32 of 2009 on Environmental Protection and Management (as so amended, the “Environmental Law”). The Environmental Law is based on the concepts of sustainable development, prevention, precaution and a “polluter pays” principle and introduced environmental documentation and licensing requirements. Under the Environmental Law, all business activities must have an environmental document, either in the form of an environmental impact planning document (Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan (“AMDAL”)), an environmental management/monitoring efforts report (Upaya Pengelolaan Lingkungan Hidup dan Upaya Pemantauan Lingkungan Hidup (“UKL-UPL”)), or a written statement on readiness to manage and monitor the environment (Surat Pernyataan Pengelolaan Lingkungan Hidup (“SPPL”)). An AMDAL is a comprehensive study of the potentially significant environmental impacts of a proposed business. A UKL-UPL covers the monitoring and management efforts undertaken by businesses that are unlikely to have a significant impact on the environment. An SPPL is typically required by services providers. These documents must be obtained before the business can apply for a business license. The Law on Job Creation simplified such environmental licensing policy by, among other things, integrating the environmental license into the business license (perizinan berusaha) which is now administered through the Online Single Submission (“OSS”) system. The OSS system is an electronic licensing platform managed by the OSS Body, which is part of the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal).

The Ministry of Environment and Forestry received a budget for 2020 of Rp6,779.6 billion, or approximately U.S.$480.7 million, for 2021 of Rp7,957.1 billion, or approximately U.S.$509.4 million, for 2022 of Rp7,120.4 billion, or approximately U.S.$496.2 million, for 2023 of Rp7,516.0 billion, or approximately U.S.$507.8 million, for 2024 of Rp7,715.1 billion, or approximately U.S.$514.3 million. Under the new administration of President Prabowo Subianto, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry has been restructured into two distinct ministries: the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Forestry. Their allocated budgets for 2025 are Rp1,079.8 billion, or approximately U.S.$67.1 million, and Rp5,158.5 billion, or approximately U.S.$320.5 million, respectively.

The budgets are focused on improving water quality, air quality, forest and land rehabilitation, mangrove rehabilitation, hazardous material and hazardous waste management, conservation forest management, domestic waste management, and environmental law enforcement.

In recent years, Jakarta has been plagued by frequent floods amid peaks in the rainy season given inadequate infrastructure and water management, resulting in the temporary relocation of tens of thousands of residents. Jakarta is also experiencing land subsidence issues primarily due to deep groundwater extraction combined with demand pressure from high-rise buildings in Jakarta. To address this, the Ministry of Public Works and Housing introduced a National Capital Integrated Coastal Development master plan, under which a giant seawall is proposed to be constructed in the north of Jakarta Bay in an effort to protect Jakarta from floods, and large lagoons will be built within the seawall to accommodate the water flow from 13 rivers in Jakarta. The project is under construction and has a target completion date of 2030, which was extended from the initial target of 2025 due to unforeseen complexities such as the protracted land acquisition process.

In addition, the Ministry of Public Works and Housing is collaborating with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry on an environmental program to build regional domestic waste infrastructure and domestic wastewater treatment in order to improve environmental quality.

Energy Security

To enhance energy security, promote economic self-sufficiency, and support sustainable development, the Government is accelerating the development of biodiesel. Beginning in 2025, the Government started to implement its B40 biodiesel mandate, which requires a 40% blend of palm oil-based fuel with 60% diesel. The target is to increase this blend to 50% by 2027. To facilitate the implementation of biodiesel, the Government is providing financial support, including a projected annual biodiesel incentive of Rp35.8 trillion and projected annual biodiesel subsidy and compensation of Rp51.4 trillion from 2025 to 2029.

In addition, the Government is encouraging private sector participation in the development of the upstream electricity ecosystem, which encompasses electricity generation and transmission. This sector has traditionally been dominated by SOEs, but the Government believes that greater private sector involvement is key to satisfy the country’s electrification investment needs. The Government has set a target for renewable energy to account for 19% of Indonesia’s power generation by 2029 and 23% by 2034. To achieve these goals, the required investments are estimated at Rp1,410 trillion by 2029 and Rp2,820 trillion by 2034.

Population

Indonesia had a population of approximately 281.6 million in 2024 and is the fourth most populous country in the world, after India, China and the United States. The population is primarily concentrated in Java (estimated at approximately 156.9 million in 2023). In 2024, Jakarta, the capital, was estimated to have a population of approximately 11.4 million.

Indonesia’s population is young and growing. In 2024, the Government estimated that approximately 23.7% of the population was under 15 years of age, approximately 69.1% was 15 to 64 years of age, and approximately 7.3% was 65 years of age or above. The annual population growth rate during the period of 2020 to 2024 was 1.1% per annum.

Indonesia’s population is predominantly Muslim, with a significant Christian minority and the remaining consists of Hindus, Buddhists and followers of other religions. Indonesia’s population is primarily of Malay descent, but consists of more than 300 ethnic groups, including the Acehnese, Batak and Minangkabau in Sumatera; the Javanese and Sundanese in Java; the Madurese in Madura; the Balinese in Bali; the Sasak in Lombok; the Minahasan, Makassarese, Toraja and Bugis in Sulawesi; the Dayak in Kalimantan; and the Dani and Asmat in Papua. The country’s population also includes people of Chinese, Arab, Eurasian, Indian and Pakistani backgrounds.

The national language is Bahasa Indonesia, which is based on the Malay language. English is widely used and taught in most secondary schools.

In total, approximately 500 languages and dialects are spoken throughout Indonesia.

Government and Political Developments

Political History and Development of Political Parties

From 1605 until its independence in 1945, Indonesia was under almost continuous Dutch colonial rule. The period of Dutch administration was interrupted by a short period of British colonial rule in the 19th century and ended by the Japanese occupation for three years before Indonesia proclaimed its independence on August 17, 1945. In the same year, Indonesia adopted its Constitution. In 1967, the executive power was transferred from President Soekarno to General Soeharto who served as Indonesia’s President until 1998, when he resigned in the aftermath of social unrest that followed the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

The post-Soeharto era, which is known in Indonesia as the Reformasi, led to changes in various governmental institutions and structural reforms of the judiciary, legislature, and executive office. Between 1999 and 2002, the Constitution was amended to strengthen constitutional checks-and-balances and the separation of powers and provide for a more direct democracy.

While Indonesia has successfully conducted elections in the past, the country continues to face various socio- political issues and has, from time to time, experienced political instability and social and civil unrest. Since 2000, demonstrations have taken place in Jakarta and other Indonesian cities both for and against former President Megawati and subsequent administrations, as well as in response to specific issues, including the introduction of new bills, laws and/or policies by the Government, reductions in fuel or electricity subsidies, privatization of state assets, anticorruption measures, decentralization and provincial autonomy, actions of former Government officials and their family members, and geopolitical events. Despite a few demonstrations that turned disruptive, Indonesia has gone through several major elections that were generally peaceful and led to successful transition.

2024 Indonesian General Elections

The 2024 general election was held on February 14, 2024 to elect the president, the vice president, members of the House of Representatives (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (“DPR”)), members of the Regional Representatives’ Council (Dewan Perwakilan Daerah (“DPD”)), and members of local legislative bodies at the province and regency levels.

On March 20, 2024, the general election commission confirmed the election of Prabowo Subianto and Gibran Rakabuming Raka to serve as president and vice president, respectively, until 2029. Members of the DPR, DPD and local legislative bodies were sworn in on October 1, 2024, and the president and the vice president were sworn in on October 20, 2024.

Central Government

The Government is based on the Constitution, under which the Republic is structured as a unitary republic. The Constitution enshrines a set of fundamental principles known as Pancasila (the five principles), encompassing belief in one supreme God, humanity, the unity of Indonesia, democracy led by the wisdom of deliberations among representatives and social justice for all.

The Constitution vests the sovereignty in the country’s people and establishes the office of the President, the People’s Consultative Assembly (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat, or the “MPR”), which consists of the DPR and the DPD, the Supreme Court (Mahkamah Agung), the Constitutional Court (Mahkamah Konstitusi) and the Judicial Commission (Komisi Yudisial).

The MPR has the authority to amend the Constitution and inaugurate and dismiss the President. The MPR has a bicameral structure, consisting of the DPR, which is the principal legislative body, and the DPD. The DPR has 580 members. Starting from 2024, the DPD has 152 members, consisting of four members from each province.

Members of the DPR are elected by a proportional representation system. The DPD members are elected in non-partisan elections based on a plurality of votes within the relevant electorate.

Each of the DPR and the President has the power to initiate legislation. All legislation, including the Republic’s budget, must be approved by both the DPR and the President. While the DPD is able to initiate legislation regarding regional matters, this is subject to approval from both the DPR and the President.

The President has the authority and responsibility for the conduct of the administration of the Republic. This includes the authority to declare war, make peace, conclude treaties with other states and propose statutes; these presidential actions must, however, be approved by the DPR before taking effect. Constitutional amendments in 1999 restrict the President and Vice President to a maximum of two five-year terms.

The President is assisted in the administration of his responsibilities by ministers who are appointed and dismissed by the President and who are responsible only to the President.

Formation of Cabinet under President Prabowo Subianto’s administration

On October 21, 2024, one day after his inauguration, President Prabowo Subianto issued Presidential Regulation Number 139 of 2024 on the Arrangement of Duties and Functions of State Ministries in the Red and White Cabinet for the 2024-2029 period. The 48 ministries include 22 new ministries and agencies, created through the establishment of new entities and the reorganization of existing ones. Seven of the 48 ministries are coordinating ministries which oversee and coordinate the ministries and agencies within their respective sectors, compared to four coordinating ministries under the prior administration. President Prabowo Subianto also dissolved the Cabinet Secretariat, a government agency that previously worked directly beneath and was answerable to the President, mandating that its duties and functions be integrated into the ministries responsible for managing the relevant government affairs.

Asta Cita

President Prabowo Subianto and Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka have adopted a comprehensive strategy to address Indonesia’s socio-economic challenges. The strategy, which is also referred to by the sanskit term “Asta Cita” (eight aspirations), comprises:

 	1.
strengthening the Constitutionally-enshrined ideology of Pancasila (the five principles), democracy, and human rights;

 	2.
consolidating the national defense and security system and fostering national self-reliance through self- sufficiency in food, energy, water, Islamic economy, digital economy, green economy and blue economy;

 	3.
continuing infrastructure development and improving quality employment opportunities, promoting entrepreneurship, expanding creative industries, and developing agro-maritime industries in production centers through active cooperative involvement;

 	4.
strengthening the development of human resources, gender equality and the achievements in respect of science, technology, education, health and sports, and empowering the roles of women, youth (millennials and Generation Z), and persons with disabilities;

 	5.
continuing downstream processing and developing natural resource-based industries to increase domestic value-add in the supply chain;

 	6.
fostering economic growth, equity, and poverty eradication from the village and grassroot levels;

 	7.
intensifying political, legal, and bureaucratic reform, and strengthening efforts to prevent and eradicate corruption, drugs, gambling, and smuggling; and

 	8.
promoting harmonious lives in alignment with the environment, nature and culture, and increasing religious tolerance to achieve a just and prosperous society.

Revision of Law No. 34/2004 on the Indonesian Military

On March 20, 2025, the House of Representatives, or DPR, amended Law No. 34/2004 on the Indonesian Military pursuant to Law No. 3 of 2025. The amendment introduces several changes, including provisions to raise the retirement ages of senior military officers and introduce two new duties for military operations other than war: resolving cyber defense threats and protecting and safeguarding citizens and national interests abroad. Additionally, pursuant to an amendment that has attracted criticism from observers as being at risk of undermining civilian supremacy, the amendment expanded the list of government agencies where military personnel can hold positions. Previously, military personnel could serve in ten primarily security-related government agencies, such as the Ministry of Defense and the State Intelligence Agency. The amended law now permits military personnel to assume positions in certain other agencies, including the National Border Management Agency, the National Counterterrorism Agency, the Maritime Security Agency, and the Attorney General’s Office, without requiring the military personnel to retire or resign from military service before taking those positions. Military personnel must still retire or resign from the military if they wish to assume positions in other agencies that are not covered by the amended law.

Judicial System

The Constitution states that the Indonesian judicial system must be independent and that judicial authority is to be exercised by the courts free from the influence of non-judicial power. The Republic’s judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Court, various lower courts and the Constitutional Court. The courts below the Supreme Court are organized by subject matter jurisdiction. These courts include the general, religious, military and administrative courts. The general courts have jurisdiction over all criminal and civil cases outside the limited jurisdiction of any of the special courts. The religious courts have jurisdiction over cases such as family law among Muslims. The military courts have jurisdiction over cases involving military personnel. The administrative courts have jurisdiction over actions involving certain Government decisions.

Furthermore, there are several special courts under the general courts and the administrative courts such as (i) commercial courts, which have jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases and intellectual property rights cases (except trade secrets); (ii) juvenile courts, which have jurisdiction over child cases; (iii) human rights courts, which have jurisdiction over gross violations of human rights cases; (iv) corruption courts, which have jurisdiction over corruption cases; (v) labor courts, which have jurisdiction over industrial relations cases; (vi) fishery courts, which have jurisdiction over criminal fishery cases; and (vii) tax courts which have jurisdiction over tax disputes. The Supreme Court also has the authority to issue opinions on legal matters to various Government authorities and officials, to order a court to adjudicate a particular matter or to set aside an unlawful decision. The Constitutional Court has exclusive jurisdiction with respect to questions of constitutional law.

Regional Governments and Regional Autonomy

Indonesia has 38 provinces, including the special capital region of Jakarta. Each province is headed by a governor and consists of several subdivisions. There are two types of subdivisions, namely kabupaten, or regencies, and kota, or municipalities. Political and governmental arrangements in regencies and municipalities are generally similar, but municipalities tend to be more urban. Regencies and municipalities are divided into kecamatan, or districts, which in turn are further divided into kelurahan, or villages, or sub-districts. Indonesia consists of 416 regencies and 98 municipalities in 38 provinces. The latest regional elections were held on November 27, 2024 across 37 provinces, 415 regencies and 93 municipalities.

Over the past two decades, the central Government has promoted and created significant regional autonomy through legislation. Under current law, government matters are divided into three areas:

 	(i)
matters that are solely under the authority of the central Government, such as foreign affairs, defense, security, judicial, national fiscal and monetary matters, and religion;

 	(ii)
matters that are concurrently implemented by the central Government, provincial governments and regency/municipal governments. Based on the Law on Job Creation, the Government may determine the implementation of these concurrent matters based on, among others, certain norms, standards, procedures and criteria as determined by the central Government. These include:

 	(a)
mandatory matters to be implemented by regional governments, namely basic services, which consists of education, health, public works and special planning, housing, social order and social welfare, and non-basic services. Social welfare and non-basic services are further divided into other matters such as labor, women’s empowerment and child protection, food sustainability, land policy, living environment, population administration and civil registration, community and village empowerment, population control and family planning, transportation, communication and informatics, cooperatives, plantations, investment, youth and sports, statistics, encryption, culture, libraries and archives; and

 	(b)
optional matters to be implemented by regional governments, namely maritime and fisheries, tourism, agriculture, forestry, energy and mineral resources, trade, industry and transmigration; and

 	(iii)
matters that are solely under the authority of the President as head of Government, such as Army, Navy and Air Force affairs, the appointment and the replacement of ambassadors and consuls, the granting of pardon and rehabilitation, amnesty and abolition, award of titles, decorations and other marks of state honor.

The provinces of Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, West Papua, South Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, and South West Papua enjoy special autonomy from the central Government. In Papua and West Papua, a portion of the population has shown support for the Free Papua Movement (generally known by its Indonesian initials, OPM). While there have been some violent incidents involving the armed wing of the OPM, including those targeting the Indonesian police, the National Armed Forces and police have taken measures to maintain security and order in these provinces, and the Government has continued its policy of promoting social welfare in Papua, West Papua, South Papua, Central Papua, Highland Papua, and South West Papua. The Government is addressing the concerns of certain groups seeking greater independence by expanding the powers of the local governments, investing in infrastructure, improving judicial access, instituting affirmative action programs, working to resolve differences among local ethnic groups, increasing welfare programs and infrastructure development and fostering business growth and investment in areas populated by these groups.

Terrorism

Several terrorism-linked bombing incidents have taken place in Indonesia over the years, including incidents linked to ISIS and Jemaah Islamiah, a Southeast Asian terrorist network linked to other terrorist organizations outside the region. In response to these incidents, security forces and the judiciary took action to bring the perpetrators to justice and have targeted terrorist networks. Since the emergence of ISIS, several terror attacks have been committed by ISIS or ISIS affiliated groups in Indonesia.

The deadliest terror attacks in Indonesia since 2002 Bali bombings were the Surabaya bombings on May 13, 2018, in which 15 civilians, one police officer and 13 suicide bombers were killed, and around 50 people were injured, and the Mako Brimob standoff on May 9, 2018, in which five police officers were killed. There have since been sporadic, less deadly suicide bombings and other instances of terrorism in Indonesia, though the threat remains and there could be additional outbursts of violence and destruction in the country.

Indonesia’s counter-terrorism efforts include laws in respect of counter-terrorism, anti-radicalization, money laundering, cyber security, and training efforts for police and security officers (including sending officers to Canada and the United States for training). Indonesia also participates in regional counter-terrorism efforts through the Association of South East Asian Nations (“ASEAN”), and global efforts through the United Nations. The Government also adopted de-radicalization/counter narrative measures as well as bolstered police anti-terror units with additional personnel, equipment and training. Over the course of the Widodo administration, several hundred terrorist suspects have been reformed through de-radicalization measures.

Foreign Relations and International and Regional Organizations

Indonesia maintains close diplomatic relationships with neighboring countries and its major economic partners and aims to continue to strengthen economic relations with all its partners.

The Republic is one of the five founding members of ASEAN, an organization that was established in 1967 to ensure regional stability and is now committed to reducing development gaps among its member states (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), which have entered into various agreements on mutual assistance and cooperation in several areas.

Indonesia assumed ASEAN’s annual rotating chairmanship for 2023 in November 2022, adopting the theme “ASEAN Matters: Epicentrum of Growth” and focusing on four areas including finance and health cooperation, food security, local currency transactions and regional payment connectivity. As part of the Republic’s chairmanship, to foster ASEAN and ASEAN+3 cooperation, Indonesia organized a series of meetings including, among others, the 42nd ASEAN Summit in Labuan Bajo in May 2023, the 43rd ASEAN Summit in Jakarta in September 2023, the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers’ and Central Bank Governors’ Meeting in Incheon, May 2023 and the 10th ASEAN Finance Ministers’ and Central Bank Governors’ Meeting in Jakarta in August 2023.

The Republic’s other principal memberships in international and regional organizations include:

 	•
United Nations;

 	•
the IMF;

 	•
the World Bank and certain World Bank-related organizations;

 	•
the Asian Development Bank (“ADB”);

 	•
the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization;

 	•
the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (“CGIF”);

 	•
the Group of Twenty (“G20”), in which it is the only ASEAN member state that concurrently enjoys membership;

 	•
the Islamic Development Bank;

 	•
World Trade Organization;

 	•
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (“APEC”), where it was one of the 12 founding economies and continues to play an important role;

 	•
the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, an initiative by the government of China which has a mission to improve social and economic outcomes by investing in sustainable infrastructure and other productive sectors in Asia and beyond;

 	•
the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund, a collaborative initiative between ASEAN countries and the ADB to establish a joint funding institution for infrastructure development in the ASEAN region; and

 	•
the Indian Ocean Rim Association (“IORA”).

Indonesia also seeks to lead other developing countries through its membership in the following organizations of developing countries: the Non-Aligned Movement, the Organization of the Islamic Conference, the Group of 77 and China, the Developing 8, the Group of 15, and as observer at the G-24 Forum.

Since 1962, the Republic has been a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”). In view of the shift in its status from a net exporter to a net importer of oil, the Republic suspended its membership in OPEC effective from January 2009. The Republic reactivated its OPEC membership effective from January 2016, but due to policy considerations and its continuing status as a net importer of oil, the Republic decided to suspend its OPEC membership during the November 30, 2016 OPEC meeting. On May 24, 2017, the Republic sent OPEC a letter requesting reactivation of its membership on the condition that Indonesian crude oil production would not have to be cut. In December 2017, the Government decided not to continue the reactivation process.

In terms of bilateral cooperation with China, Indonesia has been pursuing opportunities to support Government’s infrastructure connectivity development program through the Belt and Road Initiative. This initiative led by the People’s Republic of China, comprises two segments: (i) the Silk Road Economic Belt, a land road route western mainland China that leads to Central Asia up to the Middle East; and (ii) the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, a strategic and important sea-land encircling Southeast Asia, the Persian Gulf and reaching the Horn of Africa. This initiative promotes better connectivity among countries in Asia, Europe as well as Africa and South America, and also encourages trade balance, e-commerce, digital economy and financial inclusion. In 2017, Indonesia was actively involved in the formulation of the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development for the Belt and Road Initiative. The Republic is developing a new airport in Lembeh Island, North Sulawesi as part of its involvement in the Belt and Road Initiative.

Indonesia became a member of the IORA (an association that connects countries along the Indian Ocean region) in 1997. Since joining the IORA, Indonesia has been an active member and has directly engaged in a number of initiatives and Indonesia continues to promote economic and maritime diplomacy in the Indian Ocean region. Indonesia hosted the leader’s summit of IORA in Jakarta in March 2017, which concluded with the enactment of the IORA Concord (also referred to as the Jakarta Concord), which aims to lay the foundation and set the course for cooperation within the IORA in the coming years to overcome the increasingly complex problems in the Indian Ocean region.

On January 6, 2025, Indonesia joined BRICS, an intergovernmental organization comprising ten countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates – as a full member.

Indonesia has been a key partner of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) since 2007 and became the first accession candidate country from Southeast Asia in February 2024. Indonesia submitted its initial memorandum for OECD accession on June 3, 2025.

Foreign Relations

Indonesia embraces an “independent and active” foreign policy while being committed to maintaining a world order based on freedom, perpetual peace and social justice. This policy is ingrained in Indonesia’s Constitution and is a testament to Indonesia’s alignment to the aspirations of the international community as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. In this respect, Indonesia pursues an active role in global affairs while striving to strengthen multilateralism and avoiding involvement in conflicts or polarizations among major powers. Indonesia assumes leadership roles in the international community not to advance the interests of any group of countries, but rather build bridges and facilitate discussion of all countries for the common benefit of all.

Indonesia held the G20 Presidency from December 1, 2021 until November 30, 2022, during which Indonesia carried the theme “Recover Together, Recover Stronger” at the G20 Presidency. The Indonesian Presidency focused on three strategic issues: inclusive health management, digital-based economic transformation and the transition to sustainable energy use. During the Indonesian Presidency, 437 G20 events were implemented in 24 cities throughout Indonesia and hundreds of bilateral meetings were held, and 226 multilateral projects, programs and initiatives and 140 bilateral mature projects with a total value of U.S.$71.5 billion were delivered. The G20 Summit was held in Bali, Indonesia from November 15 to 16, 2022, and was attended by more than 10,000 delegations. Moreover, Indonesia continues to voice out developing and Global South countries’ needs and interests in various issues such as climate financing, sustainable development and energy transition.

As part of its effort to tackle the common issues faced by archipelagic and island states, such as sea level rise and climate change, Indonesia convened the 1st High-Level Meeting of Archipelagic and Island States Forum in Bali on October 11, 2023. The meeting was attended by 32 countries and four international organizations, and is intended to become a platform of inclusive collaboration that produces strategic and concrete solutions to the needs of its members.

Maritime Boundaries Delimitation and the South China Sea

The Government has conducted border diplomacy with its 10 neighboring countries, namely, India, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Australia.

Indonesia has agreed on the following maritime boundaries:

 	•
several territorial sea boundaries with Malaysia (northern part of the Malacca Strait, southernmost part of the Malacca Strait, and the Sulawesi Sea) and Singapore (central, western and eastern part of the Singapore Strait), and completion of all Territorial Sea boundaries with Papua New Guinea;

 	•
Exclusive Economic Zone, or EEZ, with the Philippines, Australia, Papua New Guinea and Vietnam; and

 	•
continental shelf with India, Thailand, Malaysia (Malacca Strait and South China Sea), Vietnam, Australia and Papua New Guinea.

Negotiations on the following maritime boundaries are ongoing:

 	•
remaining segments of territorial sea boundaries with Malaysia, Singapore and Timor-Leste;

 	•
Exclusive Economic Zone with India, Thailand, Malaysia, Palau and Timor-Leste; and

 	•
continental shelf with Malaysia, the Philippines, Palau, and Timor-Leste.

Indonesia aims to resolve these maritime boundaries through peaceful and diplomatic channels in accordance with international law.

South China Sea

Indonesia has been consistent in its position that it does not have overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea with China. This position is based on the United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea (“UNCLOS”), and in line with the 2016 Award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) on the South China Sea.

In the South China Sea, Indonesia only has maritime boundaries with Malaysia and Vietnam. In 2022, Indonesia and Vietnam concluded its EEZ boundary negotiation. This significant achievement further signified Indonesia’s commitment to promote peaceful boundary negotiation and contribution to international law, in accordance with UNCLOS. Indonesia is currently negotiating the territorial sea boundary and the EEZ boundary with Malaysia.

Indonesia is working to maintain stability and security in the South China Sea in accordance with international law. In this regard, Indonesia as the non-claimant State to the South China Sea remains supportive of the negotiation of the Code of Conduct (“COC”) along with China and other ASEAN Member States which should be actionable, implementable, and in accordance with UNCLOS. The negotiation of COC has been initiated since November 2017, which is aimed to implement the 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (frequently referred to as the DOC) based on a negotiating framework agreed in August 2017. Indonesia is an active participant in ASEAN-China Senior Officials on the Implementation of the DOC and the ASEAN-China Joint Working Group on the Implementation of the DOC, which meet on a regular basis all year round to review the implementation of the DOC and to negotiate the COC.

Indonesia utilized its ASEAN Chairmanship in 2023 to accelerate the negotiation process of the COC, as it will help maintain security, safety, and stability in the region. It is hoped that the COC can become a set of rules to govern the conduct of parties in the South China Sea. In this case, the COC shall be based on international law, including UNCLOS in order to achieve a stable, safe and peaceful South China Sea region. The main elements of COC that Indonesia always emphasizes are preventing incidents; managing incidents (if they occur); and continuing with confidence building measures.

Indonesia continues to exercise its rights to pursue economic development of its exclusive economic zone off the coast of the Natuna Islands in the North Natuna Sea, which is also referred to as a part of the South China Sea. The Government remains committed to overseeing and securing the exploration and exploitation activities, and refraining from any provocative actions in maintaining peace and stability in the region.

With regard to the presence of foreign-flagged vessels in the South China Sea, Indonesia acknowledges the freedom of navigation in the Indonesian EEZ in the North Natuna Sea/South China Sea in accordance with UNCLOS. Accordingly, Indonesia has taken action against foreign-flagged fishing vessels which violate Indonesia’s sovereign rights over its EEZ.

Sustainable Development Goals

The Republic published its Sustainable Government Securities Framework dated April 2025 for the issuance of sustainable bonds and sukuks to fund projects delivering environmental and social benefits. The Sustainable Government Securities Framework updates the Republic’s prior framework, the SDGs Government Securities Framework published in September 2021. Under the current framework, sustainable securities will be issued to fund eligible expenditures with a green and blue focus of 10 categories—namely, (i) renewable and clean energy, (ii) energy efficiency, (iii) climate change adaption, (iv) clean transport, (v) waste management, waste to energy and pollution prevention and control, (vi) sustainable management of nature resources on land, (vii) sustainable management of natural resources on ocean, (viii) green tourism, (ix) green buildings, and (x) sustainable water and wastewater management—and social focus of four categories, namely, (i) employment generation and socioeconomic advancement and empowerment, (ii) food security and sustainable food systems, (iii) access to essential services, and (iv) affordable basic infrastructure. The Sustainable Government Securities Framework expressly excludes certain activities from consideration for eligible expenditures thereunder, including projects causing or contributing to deforestation, child or forced labor, adult entertainment, weapons, alcohol, tobacco, fossil fuels, gambling, highly polluting or carbon-intensive infrastructure, unsustainable biomass or feedstock projects, and wholesale or brokerage of precious metals, precious minerals, artworks and antiques.

The Republic’s 2030 SDGs targets have been described in the Roadmap of SDGs Indonesia, which was published by the Ministry of National Development Planning (“Bappenas”) pursuant to Presidential Regulation No. 59/2017. The 2030 SDGs targets include 17 targets with respect to green, social and sustainable development such as, among others, eradication of poverty and hunger, improvement of education, health and well-being, reduced inequalities, affordable and clean energy, climate action, and sustainable cities and communities. The Republic believes that eligible expenditures under the Sustainable Government Securities Framework will deliver environmental and social benefits as part of the Republic’s efforts in achieving its 2030 SDGs targets.

The Republic has implemented an evaluation and selection process to seek to ensure that the proceeds from sustainable securities are used for eligible expenditures. The process involves a budget tagging process where various ministries select and tag projects that are reviewed primarily by the Ministry of Finance for expenditures with green and blue focus and by the Bappenas for expenditures with social focus. Tagged projects that fall into one or more of the eligibility criteria and that have a project development timeline consistent with the tenor of the relevant sustainable securities may be approved by the Bappenas and the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with other line ministries, to be funded by the proceeds of the relevant sustainable securities.

The Ministry of Finance manages and allocates the proceeds from each issue of sustainable securities and the ministries utilizing the proceeds track, monitor and report to the Ministry of Finance the environmental and social benefits of the eligible expenditures in their portfolio. A sustainable securities allocation register has been established to record the allocation of proceeds therefrom. For the sustainable securities issued, the Republic currently reports the fund allocation and the respective impacts annually. This reporting policy is not a contractual obligation of the Republic, and the Republic may decide to change its reporting policy or not comply with the policy at any time. If the Republic does provide such reports, they are published on a designated page of the Ministry of Finance’s website.

Although the projects are selected in accordance with the categories recognized under the Sustainable Government Securities Framework and are developed in accordance with relevant legislation and standards, the projects may fail to deliver the benefits as anticipated, and there can be no assurance that adverse environmental and/or social impacts will not occur during the design, construction, commissioning and operation of the projects.

A second party opinion on the Sustainable Government Securities Framework was published by an independent ratings and analytics firm on April 30, 2025. confirming the framework’s alignment with the International Capital Market Association’s Green Bond Principles (2021), Social Bond Principles (2023) and Sustainability Bond Guidelines (2021), as well as the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum’s ASEAN Green Standards 2018, ASEAN Social Bond Standards 2021 and ASEAN Sustainability Bond Standards 2018. The second party opinion is not, nor should be deemed to be, a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities.

Economy and Gross Domestic Product

Introduction

Indonesia has a balanced and diversified economy. The main challenges currently facing Indonesia’s economy include uncertainty in relation to the global economic recovery and commodity prices, which are crucial factors in determining the Republic’s export performance.

Domestically, factors that affect the economy are demographic growth and job creation, the country’s progress in implementing its infrastructure programs, maintaining relatively stable and low inflation and balancing domestic budgetary pressures against the burden of serving external debt.

Principal Sectors of the Economy

Indonesia’s principal economic sectors are manufacturing industry (including coal, oil and gas); agriculture, forestry and fishery; wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; construction; and mining and quarrying.

The tables below show the composition of Indonesia’s GDP by sector at current prices and constant prices, respectively, for the periods indicated.

Manufacturing Industry

Indonesia’s principal manufacturing industries include food products and beverages, coal and refined petroleum products, fabricated metal products, computer, electronic and optical products and electrical equipment. Other major manufacturing industries include transport equipment and chemicals, pharmaceuticals and botanical products. Manufacturing has been the largest contributor to economic growth since the 1980s. The manufacturing industry sector consists of the sub-sectors of (i) coal industry and oil and gas refining and (ii) non-coal, oil and gas manufacturing industries.

In 2020, Indonesia’s manufacturing industries contracted by 2.9%, compared to 2019, primarily due to a 6.8% contraction in the coal, oil and gas refinery industry. Non-coal, oil and gas manufacturing industries declined by 2.5%, primarily due to contractions in the transport equipment industry and the machinery equipment industry, which contracted by 19.9% and 10.2%, respectively.

In 2021, Indonesia’s manufacturing industry grew by 3.4%, compared to 2020. Non-coal, oil and gas manufacturing industries grew by 3.7%, mainly driven by growth in the transportation equipment industry, basic metal industry, and machinery and equipment industry sub-sector, which grew by 17.8%, 11.5% and 11.4% respectively.

In 2022, the manufacturing industry grew by 4.9%, compared to 2021. This was due to a growth of 5.0% in the non-coal, oil and gas manufacturing industries and a growth of 3.7% in the coal, oil and gas refining industry, each as compared to 2021. The 5.0% growth in the non-coal, oil and gas manufacturing industries was primarily driven by a growth of 14.8% in the basic metals industry due to increased production of iron and steel as well as increasing foreign demand of basic metals, a growth of 10.7% in transportation equipment industry as a result of increased car production and a growth of 4.9% in food and beverages industry primarily because the growing demand for downstream natural resource products boosted refined crude palm oil production.

In 2023, the manufacturing industry grew by 4.6%, compared to 2022 and was the main source of economic growth in 2023. This was due to a 4.7% growth in the non-coal, oil and gas manufacturing industries and a 4.2% growth in the coal, oil and gas refining industry, each as compared to 2022. This performance was primarily driven by relatively strong domestic and global demand for Indonesian export products, such as basic metal industry products, metal goods, and transportation equipment. The results of the downstreaming policy contributed to the growth of the basic metal industry, which grew by 14.2%, compared to 2022. The metal goods, computers, electronic goods, optics, and electrical equipment industry grew by 13.7%, compared to 2022 due to increased demand for metal goods because of increased construction activity. Similarly, the transportation equipment industry grew by 7.6%, primarily due to an increased demand for motorcycles.

In 2024, the manufacturing sector grew by 4.4%, compared to 2023, driven by both domestic and external demand. This was primarily attributable to a growth of 13.3% in base metal industry, supported by Indonesia’s downstreaming policy, a growth of 5.9% in chemical, pharmaceutical and traditional medicine industry, a growth of 5.9% in food and beverage industry and a growth of 6.2% in metal goods, computers, electronic goods, optics and electrical equipment industry, driven by strong global and domestic demand for electronic components.

In the first quarter of 2025, the manufacturing sector grew by 4.5%, compared to the first quarter of 2024, driven by both domestic and external demand, as well as downstreaming activities. In the first quarter of 2025, the food and beverage subsector, which accounted for 34.7% of the manufacturing sector, grew by 6.0%, supported by higher demand during Ramadan and increased rice milling activities. Growth in the manufacturing sector was also bolstered by a growth of 14.5% in base metal industry, supported by rising export demand, particularly for iron and steel products. Additionally, the footwear industry grew by 7.0%, in line with higher demand both domestically and internationally.

The growth in manufacturing sector is in line with the Government’s downstreaming policy and policy of increasing the use of domestic products. The downstreaming policy aims to develop more value-added manufacturing and refining industries that add value to the raw materials before export. For example, since 2020 the Republic has banned the export of raw nickel and instead sought to encourage, through measures including tax incentives and local content requirements, onshore investment in industries that produce nickel-based products such as batteries for electric vehicles.

The downstreaming policy originally focused on a few mining commodities—i.e., nickel, copper, tin, bauxite and coal—and the Government has gradually expanded the policy coverage to other products. Under the administration of President Prabowo Subianto, the Government has devised a downstreaming roadmap encompassing over two dozen commodities, including not only mining commodities, but also gas, petroleum, agricultural products, forestry and marine resources, with priority accorded to: nickel, tin, copper, bauxite, iron/steel, silica sand, gas, petroleum, oil palm, coconut, shrimp, tuna fish, seaweed, salt, and tilapia. The Government expects Indonesia’s downstreaming policy to attract investment of up to U.S.$618.1 billion and create up to three million jobs by 2040.

The Government has also implemented policies of increasing the use of domestic products, such as local content regulation aimed at bolstering domestic manufacturing and reducing reliance on imports. In November 2024, the Government temporarily banned the sale of products by a major international electronics manufacturer for failing to comply with a local content requirement that mandates that 35% of components in electronic devices be locally sourced. The Government expects to continue to emphasize its downstreaming and local content policies to support Indonesia’s push to become part of global value-added supply chains and its broader growth ambitions.

Wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles

The wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles sector includes wholesale and retail trade, as well as the repair of motor vehicles, including motorcycles. In recent years, this has generally been the third largest segment of the economy, behind manufacturing and agriculture, forestry and fishery.

In 2020, the wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles sector declined by 3.8%, compared to 2019, mainly driven by a 14.1% contraction in the wholesale, retail trade, and repairs of cars and motorcycles sub-sector. The wholesale and retail trade of non-cars and motorcycles sub-sector declined by 1.4%.

In 2021, the wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles sector increased by 4.7%, compared to 2020. This was mainly driven by the trade of cars, motorbikes and repair sub-sector, which grew by 12.1%, as a result of the implementation of sales tax incentives on luxurious goods which drove an increase in the number of car sales.

In 2022, the wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles sector grew by 5.5%, compared to 2021. This was driven by a growth of 5.9% in the trade of cars, motorbikes and repair subsector and a growth of 5.4% in the big trade and retail (not cars and motorcycles) subsector. These growths were driven by increased vehicle sales and the population’s increased visits to shopping areas, in line with the easing of mobility restrictions.

In 2023, the wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles sector grew by 4.8%, compared to 2022. This was driven by a growth of 4.9% in the wholesale and retail trade (excluding automobiles and motorcycles) subsector due to increased domestic trade activity and a 4.5% growth in the automobiles, motorcycles and their repairs subsector primarily due to increased sales of motorcycles (a 20.3% increase, as compared to 2022, which offset a 4.0% decrease in automobiles sales in 2023, as compared to 2022).

In 2024, the wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles sector grew by 4.9%, compared to 2023. This was driven by a growth of 5.9% in wholesale and retail trade of goods other than cars and motorcycles.

In the first quarter of 2025, the wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles sector grew by 5.0%, compared to the first quarter of 2024. This was driven by a growth of 6.2% in wholesale and retail trade of goods other than cars and motorcycles.

Agriculture, forestry and fishery

The agriculture, forestry and fishery sector consists of the sub-sectors of (i) agriculture, livestock, hunting and agriculture services, (ii) forestry and logging, and (iii) fishery.

In 2020, the agriculture, forestry, and fishery sector grew by 1.8%, compared to 2019. This growth was mainly driven by the agriculture, livestock, hunting and agriculture services sub-sector, which grew by 2.1%, compared to 2019. The fishery sub-sector grew by 0.7% and the forestry and logging sub-sector declined by 0.03%, in 2020.

In 2021, the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector grew by 1.8%, compared to 2020. This growth was mainly driven by the fishery sub-sector which grew by 5.5% due to an increased production of captured fish and seaweed cultivation. The agriculture, livestock, hunting, and agriculture services sub-sector grew by 1.1% and the forestry and logging sub-sector grew by 0.1%, as compared to 2020.

In 2022, the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector grew by 2.3%, compared to 2021. This growth was mainly driven by a growth of 2.8% in fishery subsector driven by increased production in captured and farmed fisheries, and a growth of 2.3% in agriculture, livestock, hunting, and agriculture services subsector partly due to the increases in rice, palm oil and cocoa production. The forestry and logging subsector declined by 1.3%, as compared to 2021, due to a significant decrease in log production in community forests.

In 2023, the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector grew by 1.3%, compared to 2022. This low growth was primarily due to the El Niño phenomenon, which caused a reduction in the production of food crops such as rice, corn, peanuts, and seasonal horticultural products such as vegetables. As such, the food crop and horticultural subsectors experienced contractions of 3.9% and 0.3%, respectively, compared to 2022. The fisheries subsector grew by 5.5% compared to 2022, primarily due to increased seaweed production. The livestock subsector grew by 3.7%, compared to 2022, due to the distribution of corn feed stocks to small-scale farmers to revive poultry farming businesses. The forestry and logging subsector grew by 2.6% compared to 2022 due to increased foreign demand for wood and non-timber forest products. The plantation subsector also grew by 1.7% compared to 2022, as a result of increased demand for palm oil products, both domestically and internationally.

In 2024, the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector grew by 0.7%, compared to 2023. This was primarily due to a growth of 2.8% in animal husbandry and a growth of 0.7% in plantation crops.

In the first quarter of 2025, the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector grew by 10.5%, compared to the first quarter of 2024. This was primarily due to a growth of 42.3% in food crops. The peak harvest season for rice and corn shifted back to the first quarter, following a delay to the second quarter in the previous year due to the impact of El Niño.

The following table sets forth production statistics for Indonesia’s most important agricultural products for the periods indicated.

Mining and Quarrying

Indonesia is a significant player in the global mining and quarrying industry with significant production of natural gas, coal, crude oil, tin, nickel, bauxite and copper.

In 2020, the mining and quarrying sector declined by 2.0%, compared to 2019, primarily due to contractions in the oil, gas, and geothermal mining sub-sector and the coal and lignite mining sub-sector, which respectively contracted by 6.0% and 5.4%. This contraction was offset by a growth in metal ore mining sub-sector, which grew by 20.3%.

In 2021, the mining and quarrying sector grew by 4.0%, compared to 2020. This was mainly driven by the metal ore mining sub-sector, which grew by 22.8% due to increase in copper and gold production. The oil, gas and geothermal mining sub-sector contracted by 4.4% due to a decrease in the amount of oil production.

In 2022, the mining and quarrying sector grew by 4.4%, compared to 2021. This was mainly driven by a growth of 18.0% in metal ore mining subsector driven by increased production of copper and gold in the mineral district of Grasberg, Papua, and increased demand from abroad, especially for gold and copper commodities. The coal and lignite mining subsector grew by 8.1% and the other mining and quarrying subsector saw a growth of 2.3%, due to the increased exports of mining commodities such as natural sand, precious stones, and natural asphalt. On the contrary, the oil, gas and geothermal mining subsector declined by 4.8%, as compared to 2021, due to unplanned shutdowns.

In 2023, the mining and quarrying sector grew by 6.1%, compared to 2022. This was mainly driven by a growth of 10.0% in the coal and lignite mining industry attributable to growth in coal exports, a growth of 8.5% in metal ore mining industry, driven by increased production of minerals such as gold, copper and nickel, and a growth of 5.4% in mining and other quarrying industry due to increased exports of mining commodities such as gemstones, gravel and sand. The oil and gas subsector grew by 0.7%, compared to 2022, in line with the optimization of oil exploitation and the exploitation of new gas sources after experiencing contractions in recent years.

In 2024, the mining and quarrying sector grew by 4.9%, compared to 2023. This was driven by a growth of 8.3% in metal ore mining, a growth of 6.8% in coal and lignite mining and a growth of 6.3% in mining and other excavations.

In the first quarter of 2025, the mining and quarrying sector declined by 1.2%, compared to the first quarter of 2024. This was due to a decline of 11.8% in metal ore mining and a decline of 0.9% in coal and lignite mining. Gold and copper production fell due to major scheduled maintenance at the copper and gold mines in Central Papua, and coal production declined in response to weakening demand in international markets. The declines were partially offset by a growth of 3.7% in mining and other excavations and a growth of 2.6% in oil, gas and geothermal mining.

As products in the mining and quarrying sector are internationally traded commodities with prices set by the world markets, the performance of this sub-sector is primarily affected by international market prices. See “— Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments — Exports and Imports.”

Oil and Natural Gas

The oil and gas market in Indonesia is characterized by the presence of large, diversified companies with highly vertically integrated operations throughout oil exploration, production, refining, transportation and marketing. Pertamina, a state-owned enterprise, or SOE, plays an important role in the production of oil and gas in Indonesia.

Oil and gas exports contributed 5.1%, 5.3%, 5.5%, 6.1%, 6.0% and 5.5% to total exports in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and the first four months of 2025, respectively. In 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024, oil and gas revenues comprised 6.2%, 7.4%, 8.6%, 6.7% and 6.3%, respectively, of the Government’s domestic revenue (inclusive of income tax revenue from the oil and gas sub-sector). The fluctuations in exports and contribution to domestic revenue are due to the natural decline in the reservoir performance and lack of discovery and production of replacement reserves, fluctuating commodities pricing during the period and also the growth of other sectors in the economy.

Proven natural gas reserves represent marketable volumes that generate sales revenue. Estimates of proven natural gas reserves are comparable to estimates prepared using international standards and include total volume without regard to the direct economic benefit of Indonesia. Estimates are prepared pursuant to the Petroleum Resources Management System sponsored by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Minerals

The Republic’s major mineral products are coal, nickel, copper and bauxite, and it has substantial resources of each of these minerals. In recent years, the Government has pursued policies designed to increase the production and export of value-added products using these mineral resources.

Under Law No. 4 of 2009 on Mineral and Coal Mining enacted by the Government in January 2009 (which was subsequently amended by Law No. 3 of 2020 enacted in June 2020 and further amended by Article 39 of the Law on Job Creation, as so amended, the “Mining Law”), two new types of licenses were created: ijin usaha pertambangan (“IUP”) and ijin usaha pertambangan khusus (“IUPK”). Subsequent to the enactment of the Mining Law, the Government issued various regulations thereunder, including (i) regulations mandating the domestic processing and refining of minerals, (ii) regulations requiring the reclamation of areas affected by mining activities, (iii) regulations related to local community development and empowerment, optimization and conservation of mineral resources, and job opportunities for local mining service providers and local communities surrounding a mining area and (iv) regulations relating to procedures for the granting of a production operation special mining permit, which provide guidelines for the granting of an operation production IUPK in order to continue the operation of a contract of work.

Grasberg Copper Mine

On September 27, 2018, the Indonesian state-owned enterprise PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Persero) or Inalum, entered into various agreements with Freeport McMoRan Inc, the parent company of Freeport Indonesia, the operator of the Grasberg copper mine in the province of Papua, Rio Tinto and other relevant parties in connection with Inalum’s acquisition of a 51.2% share ownership in Freeport Indonesia and other interests related to the Grasberg copper mine for a cash consideration of U.S.$3.85 billion, following a dispute between the Government and Freeport relating to the failure to convert the mine’s contract of work into an IUPK..

The transaction was completed in December 2018, pursuant to which Inalum owns, directly and indirectly, 51.2% beneficial equity interest in Freeport Indonesia (subject to a dividend assignment mechanism to replicate the joint venture economics), and FCX’s ownership is 48.8%. FCX continues to manage the operations of Freeport Indonesia. The Government and FCX are currently in discussions around potentially extending Freeport Indonesia’s mining rights beyond 2041.

Construction

Over the last five years, besides the development of a basic public services infrastructure, the main drivers of the construction sector were improvement works in the areas of communications and logistics infrastructure, transportation and electrification.

In 2020, the construction sector contracted by 3.3%, compared to 2019. This contraction was primarily due to reduced construction activity as a result of Covid-19, which led to delayed completion of infrastructure projects.

In 2021, the construction sector grew by 2.8%, compared to 2020. This was in line with the increase in infrastructure activities and the increase in imports of raw materials for construction activities.

In 2022, the construction sector grew by 2.0%, compared to 2021. This growth was in line with the increase in infrastructure activities and the increase in imports of raw materials for construction activities, as the Covid-19 related social restrictions eased and the economy was recovering.

In 2023, the construction sector grew by 4.9%, compared to 2022. This growth was primarily due to the Government’s capital expenditure activities to support national strategic projects and the development of basic infrastructure in the new capital city, Nusantara. Key construction indicators, such as domestic cement sales, saw a 4.1% increase in 2023, compared to 2022.

In 2024, the construction sector grew by 7.0%, compared to 2023, as a result of the continued development of Nusantara and national strategic projects, as discussed in “Infrastructure Development” below.

In the first quarter of 2025, the construction sector grew by 2.2%, compared to the first quarter of 2024. This growth was supported by an increase in imports of raw materials for construction, including glass, iron and steel products, and other related goods. However, the construction sector’s overall performance was constrained by lower government capital spending resulting from budget cuts and delayed infrastructure projects, as well as a decline in cement production due to adverse weather conditions and reduced activities during Ramadan and the Eid holidays.

Transportation and Warehousing

The transportation and warehousing sector comprises the sub-sectors of (i) railway transport, (ii) land transport, (iii) sea transport, (iv) river, lake and ferry transport, (v) air transport and (vi) warehousing and support activities for transportation; postal and courier.

In 2020, the transportation and warehousing sector contracted by 15.1%, compared to 2019. The sub-sector contributing the highest contractions was air transport at 53.1%, followed by railways transport at 42.3%. This contraction was primarily due to mobility restriction during the Covid-19 pandemic.

In 2021, the transportation and warehousing sector grew by 3.2%, compared to 2020. This was partly due to increased mobility in public transportation and recreational areas.

In 2022, the transportation and warehousing sector grew by 19.9%, compared to 2021. This was primarily due to a growth of 40.5% in warehousing and transportation support services, and post and courier, a growth of 66.9% in air freight and a growth of 8.7% in land transport.

In 2023, the transportation and warehousing sector grew by 14.0%, compared to 2022, due to increased societal mobility. In particular, air transport grew by 29.0% due to increased number of domestic and international passenger, while rail transport grew by 23.7% due to increased number of passengers, additional schedules for long-distance trains and the opening of new routes including the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail and the Jabodebek Integrated Corridor Light Rail Transit. The warehousing and transportation support services, and post and courier subsector also grew by 17.9% and the sea freight subsector grew by 15.5%.

In 2024, the transportation and warehousing sector grew by 8.7%, compared to 2023, driven by increases in passenger and cargo volumes, supported by higher mobility and increased economic activities. This was partly attributable to the hosting of national and international events that boosted the flow of domestic and international tourists in Indonesia. All the transportation and warehousing subsectors experienced growths. In particular, rail transportation grew by 18.6%, land transportation grew by 9.9%, air freight grew by 6.7% and warehousing and transportation support services and post and courier increased by 9.4%.

In the first quarter of 2025, the transportation and warehousing sector grew by 9.0%, compared to the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by an increase in public transportation passenger volume due to the New Year holidays and the shift of part of the 2025 Eid homecoming travel flow to the first quarter, whereas in 2024 it took place in the second quarter. In particular, rail transportation grew by 17.6%, land transportation grew by 9.9%, warehousing and transportation support services and post and courier increased by 9.5% and sea transportation grew by 6.9%.

Information and Communication

In 2020, the information and communication grew by 10.6% compared to 2019. This growth was primarily due to an increase in data traffic in telecommunications industry as a result of the working from home and school from home arrangements.

In 2021, the information and communication sector grew by 6.8% compared to 2020. The slower growth was partly due to decline in the information industry, which includes the printing and paper goods industry.

In 2022, the information and communication sector grew by 7.7%, compared to 2021. This growth was in line with the increased data traffic among various telecommunication service providers as well as a growth in digital banking transactions and electronic money transactions.

In 2023, the information and communication sector grew by 7.6%, compared to 2022, driven largely by digital transformation, as evidenced by increased data traffic from several telecommunications providers (from access to social media, communication services, video streaming, mobile gaming, and browsing access) as well as an increase in digital banking transactions and electronic money transactions.

In 2024, the information and communication sector grew by 7.6%, compared to 2023. This was driven by increased telecommunication data traffic during events and festivals, the rising popularity of Indonesian movies and the expansion of Indonesia’s data center industry.

In the first quarter of 2025, the information and communication sector grew by 7.7%, compared to the first quarter of 2024. This growth was fueled by higher revenues from both wired and wireless telecommunications, an increase in the number of start-ups in Indonesia, increased production of Indonesian films, and the opening of new cinemas in several regions, including West Java and Banten.

Financial and Insurance Service

In 2020, the financial and insurance service sector grew by 3.2%, compared to 2019. This growth was primarily due to a growth of 4.0% in financial intermediary services and a growth of 4.0% in insurance and pension fund, partially offset by a decline of 0.6% in other financial services.

In 2021, the financial and insurance service sector grew by 1.6%, compared to 2020. This growth was primarily due to a growth of 2.7% in financial intermediary services, partially offset by a decline of 2.4% in other financial services.

In 2022, the financial and insurance service sector grew by 1.9%, compared to 2021. This growth was primarily due to a growth of 2.4% in financial intermediary services and a growth of 4.5% in other financial services.

In 2023, the financial and insurance service sector grew by 4.8%, compared to 2022. This growth was primarily due to a growth of 7.0% in financial intermediary services and a growth of 4.0% in other financial services. These were primarily due to an increase in revenue generated from financial intermediary services (due to the widening spread between reference interest rates and deposit interest rates along with a rise in commission income for commercial banks) and enhanced revenue streams from various financing entities, including financing institutions, pawnshops, venture capital firms, infrastructure financing and guarantee institutions.

In 2024, the financial and insurance service sector grew by 4.7%, compared to 2023. This growth was primarily due to a growth of 6.8% in financial intermediary services and a growth of 4.6% in other financial services.

In the first quarter of 2025, the financial and insurance service sector grew by 4.0%, compared to the first quarter of 2024. This growth was primarily due to a growth of 5.2% in financial intermediary services and a growth of 7.7% in other financial services.

Other sectors

None of the other sectors shown in the tables above comprised more than 5.0% of GDP, at either current prices or constant prices, for the periods indicated.

Gross Domestic Product by Expenditure

In this report, GDP is shown in both current and constant prices. GDP at current prices value a country’s output using the actual prices for each year, while GDP at constant prices (also referred to as “real” GDP) value output using the prices from a base year, thereby eliminating the distorting effects of inflation and deflation.

The following tables show the distribution of GDP in the Indonesian economy by expenditure at current prices and constant prices, respectively, for the periods indicated (at current prices).

Inflation

The Government sets inflation targets periodically and targeted an inflation rate of 3.5% (±1.0%) for 2019 and 3.0% (±1.0%) for 2020 to 2023. The inflation target for 2024 is 2.5% (±1.0%). The inflation target for 2025 is 2.5% (±1.0%). Bank Indonesia enacts and implements policies to achieve the inflation target in coordination with the Government.

In addition, the Inflation Control Team (Tim Pengendalian Inflasi (“TPI”)) is responsible for identifying and analyzing the sources of inflation and making policy recommendations to maintain low and stable inflation levels in the medium-to-long term. The TPI at the national level consists of a number of governmental authorities, including Bank Indonesia, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, and the Coordinating Ministry of Economic Affairs. The TPI also operates in Indonesia’s various regions to strengthen policy coordination, particularly in monitoring and controlling regional inflation.

Annual percentage year-on-year.

Indonesia measures annual inflation by year-on-year changes in the CPI.

In 2020, annual inflation was 1.7%, which was lower than the 2.7% annual inflation in 2019. This was primarily due to deflation in the prices for: transportation; and information, communication, and financial services, which decreased by 0.9% and 0.4%, respectively. From January 2020, BPS has calculated CPI based on a consumption pattern obtained from a cost of living survey conducted in 2018 in 90 cities in Indonesia. Prior to January 2020, CPI was based on a consumption pattern obtained from a cost of living survey conducted in 2012 in 82 provincial capital cities in Indonesia.

In 2021, annual inflation was 1.9%, which was higher than the 1.7% annual inflation in 2020. This was primarily due to increases in the prices for: food, drinks and tobacco; food and beverage providers/restaurant; household equipment, tools, and routine maintenance; and personal care and other services, which increased by 3.1%, 2.7%, 2.7% and 1.7%, respectively.

In 2022, annual inflation was 5.5%, which was higher than the 1.9% annual inflation in 2021. This was primarily due to larger increases in the prices for most of the sectors. In particular, annual inflation for food, drinks and tobacco; housing, water, electricity and household fuels; health; transport; recreation, sport and culture; and personal care and other services was 5.8%, 3.8%, 4.9%, 15.3%, 3.0% and 5.9% in 2022, respectively, compared to 3.1%, 0.8%, 2.7%, 1.6%, 1.1% and 1.7% in 2021, respectively.

In 2023, annual inflation was 2.6%, which was lower than the 5.5% annual inflation in 2022. This was primarily due to smaller increases in the prices for all the sectors except food, drinks and tobacco and information, communication and financial services. Annual inflation decreased the most for transport; housing, water, electricity, and household fuel; and household equipment, tools and routine maintenance. Annual inflation for these three sectors was 1.3%, 0.5% and 1.6% in 2023, respectively, compared to 15.3%, 3.8% and 4.9% in 2022, respectively.

In 2024, annual inflation was 1.6%, which was lower than the 2.6% annual inflation in 2023. This was primarily due to smaller increases in the prices for majority of the sectors. In particular, annual inflation for food, drinks and tobacco; household equipment, tools, and routine maintenance; transportation; information, communication, and financial services; and recreation, sports, and culture was 1.9%, 1.0%, (0.3)%, (0.3)% and 1.2% in 2024, respectively, compared to 6.2%, 1.6%, 1.3%, 0.2% and 1.7% in 2023, respectively. These inflationary changes were partially offset by higher price increases in clothing and footwear; education; and personal care and other services: annual inflation for these sectors was 1.2%, 2.5% and 7.0% in 2024, respectively, compared to 0.8%, 2.1% and 3.6% in 2023, respectively.

In June 2025, annual inflation was 1.9%, which was higher than the annual inflation of 1.6% in May 2025. This increase was primarily due to higher inflation in the food, drinks, and tobacco sector, for which annual inflation was 2.0% in June 2025, compared to 1.0% in May 2025. Inflation also increased in housing, water, electricity, and household fuel; health; and personal care and other services: annual inflation for these sectors were 1.6%, 1.9% and 9.3% in June 2025, respectively, compared to 1.5%, 1.8% and 9.2% in May 2025, respectively. These inflationary changes were partially offset by lower price increases in household equipment, tools and routine maintenance; and education: annual inflation was 0.6% and 1.8% in June 2025, respectively, compared to 0.8% and 1.9% in May 2025, respectively.

Privatization and Management of State-Owned Enterprises

The sale by the Government of shares in state-owned enterprises (“SOEs”), which under Indonesian law are business entities whose capital is at least 51% directly owned by the state, to private investors has been an important means for the Government to promote private investment and to improve the efficiency, transparency, public accountability and corporate governance of the SOEs.

As of December 31, 2024, there were 64 SOEs, of which 13 were listed SOEs and 51 non-listed SOEs. The Ministry of SOEs formed clusters based on supply-chain linkages and industry similarities to increase synergies that divided into 12 clusters and 1 SOE investment holding company. The classification was based on the alignment of business models and supply chains, simplification of complexity and span of control, as well as the harmonizing of the number of SOEs.

As of December 2024, these clusters comprise: SOEs in the form of Perum and Holding Investment SOE Danareksa (22 SOEs), Infrastructure cluster (9 SOEs), Logistic and Transportation cluster (7 SOEs), Insurance cluster (5 SOEs), Banking cluster (4 SOEs), Manufacture cluster (3 SOEs), Tourism cluster (3 SOEs), Food and Agriculture cluster (3 SOEs), Energy cluster (2 SOEs), Plantations cluster (2 SOEs), Telco cluster (2 SOEs), Health Care cluster (1 SOE) and Mining cluster (1 SOE).

The Government has been restructuring SOEs and/or their subsidiaries in an effort to optimize their agility and value creation of SOEs. The Government has also been pursuing the amalgamation of SOEs that operate in the same or related industries or sectors.

The following table sets forth significant full and partial privatizations, and in some cases re-capitalization, since 2011 (including prior periods where relevant):

Indonesia Investment Authority

The Indonesia Investment Authority (“INA”), also known as the “Nusantara Investment Authority”, is the Republic’s first sovereign wealth fund and it was established in 2021 under the Law on Job Creation, with the purpose of attracting foreign capital to invest in strategic sectors of the Indonesian economy and supporting sustainable development and boost economic growth.

The initial capital of INA amounted to U.S.$5.0 billion. Since its establishment, the INA has deployed over U.S.$3.0 billion in capital together with, and secured commitments of up to U.S.$25.0 billion from investors, including foreign funds and financial institutions. INA primarily focuses on sectors targeted for sustainable development while also aiming to offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. The priority sectors for INA’s investments include transport and logistics, digitalization and digital infrastructure, green energy and transformation, and health; additionally, INA seeks investment opportunities in property and tourism, financial services, mining, oil and gas, engineering and construction, electronics, consumer goods, and food and agriculture.

Danantara

Badan Pengelola Investasi Daya Anagata Nusantara (“BPI Danantara”) is an independent legal entity that was established on February 24, 2025 through Law No. 1/2025, which is an amendment to Law No. 19/2003 on State-Owned Enterprises.

Pursuant to the amended law, the President of the Republic holds the authority to manage SOEs as part of the executive branch’s power in managing state finances, including ownership of state assets that are separated and placed in SOEs. Through Law No. 1/2025, the President’s authority is delegated to the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises as the holder of the Series A Dwiwarna shares(1) and to BPI Danantara as the holder of the Series B shares in SOEs.

The Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises acts as regulator and supervisor of SOEs, whereas BPI Danantara acts as the operator and also has the authority to manage dividends from SOEs.

BPI Danantara reports directly to the President, with a supervisory board chaired by the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises and an executive board appointed by the President. In carrying out its role, BPI Danantara has established two subsidiaries:

1. Danantara Asset Management (“DAM”), which is the entity that holds the Series B shares of SOEs that were previously held by the Government. DAM is responsible for managing the operational activities of these SOEs, with the objective to optimize the value of the SOEs under its portfolio.

2. Danantara Investment Management (“DIM”), which is the entity that holds and manages the investment and optimization of dividends. DIM aims to invest in areas of strategic importance, generate sustainable returns, and expand investment capacity including through partnerships with leading institutions.

The Series B shares of 52 SOEs in 13 sub-sectors (including special purpose entities) have been transferred to BPI Danantara through DAM. SOEs generate profits and distribute dividends to their direct owner, DAM. For 2025, the SOEs under DAM are projected to generate dividends of Rp150 trillion (based on FY2024 results), with Rp139 trillion expected to be received and managed by BPI Danantara through DAM.

DAM may reinvest the cash back into the SOEs or transfer the cash to BPI Danantara (through dividend upstreaming, as BPI Danantara owns 99% of DAM). BPI Danantara may inject the cash to DIM for investment purposes outside the SOEs.

BPI Danantara aims to help Indonesia escape the “middle income trap” by implementing a set of strategic initiatives that are anchored by the Asta Cita principles of President Prabowo Subianto’s administration (see “—Government and Political Developments—Asta Cita” for more details). These initiatives include the policies of downstreaming and industrialization, strengthening national self-reliance through food, energy, and water security, investing in low-carbon energy, resilient infrastructure as the backbone for growth, and human capital development, to name a few. Despite having different mandates, DIM and DAM share a rigorous and comprehensive risk management framework and governance under the supervision of BPI Danantara . Since its launch, BPI Danantara has sought to allay concerns about transparency, governance, and potential political interference, and has focused on establishing the credibility and intended benefits of its mandate.

(1)
Series A Dwiwarna shares refer to a special class of shares issued to the Republic or its representative. These shares, a type of golden share, grant the holder unique rights to maintain control over strategic decisions in the relevant entity, even when holding a single Series A share. The term “Dwiwarna” (meaning “two colors” in Indonesian, refers to the red and white of the national flag) symbolizes the state’s authority and national interest in SOEs.

Working age population refers to all persons in Indonesia 15 years old or older and includes certain non-workforce categories such as students and home makers.

(2)
The Government defines unemployment to include all persons 15 years old and older without work who (i) are looking for work, (ii) have established a new business, (iii) are not looking for work because they do not expect to find work, and (iv) have made arrangements to start work on a date subsequent to the unemployment measurement date.

.

Despite improvements in recent years, unemployment is expected to remain a problem in Indonesia if economic growth and job creation fail to keep pace with population growth. Youth unemployment (between the ages of 15 to 24) remains a particular problem, but has improved in recent years. The Government has sought to address employment issues through a number of policies and regulations, including efforts to create new areas of work and to develop existing areas of work through employee-employer relationships and entrepreneurial programs. The Government provides various forms of assistance (including tax relief and infrastructure support) to encourage employers to create jobs for employees while also creating and developing productive and sustainable working opportunities through entrepreneurial programs, the use of technology and encouraging voluntary work. As of February 2020, immediately prior to the severity of the Covid-19 outbreak in the country, Indonesia had its lowest unemployment rate in ten years. This improvement was due in part to a narrowing of the gap between workforce skills and the skills required in available jobs. Indonesia’s unemployment rate rose after the Covid-19 outbreak, but declined since February 2022, as a result of the easement of social restrictions and the post-Covid economic recovery.

Regional governments have the power to establish minimum wage requirements through tripartite wage boards and do so from the beginning of each calendar year. The table below sets out the national average monthly minimum wage for each year and the average increase across the country for each year. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most provinces have not increased the minimum wage for 2021.

The Government increased the average minimum wage of each province by 1.1% for 2022. The figure was obtained through the new guidelines on the minimum wage under Government Regulation No. 36 of 2021 on Wages (“GR 36/2021”).

The Government increased the national average minimum wage by 7.3% for 2023 and 6.5% for 2024. The figures were obtained through the new guidelines on the minimum wage under GR 36/2021 as amended by Government Regulation No. 51 of 2023 on the Amendment to GR 36/2021.

The Government increased the national average minimum wage by 6.5% for 2025.

Pension and Health Funds

The pension system in Indonesia consists of compulsory and voluntary pension funds. The compulsory system includes health insurance for Government employees (not including employees of SOEs) administered initially by PT Askes (Persero) and currently by BPJS Kesehatan (as defined below), pension plans for Government employees (not including employees of SOEs) administered by PT Taspen (Persero), old age savings for the police and armed forces administered by PT Asabri and old age security for private sector and SOEs employees (in companies that meet minimum requirements stipulated in the relevant law) administered initially by PT Jamsostek (Persero) and currently by BPJS Ketenagakerjaan (as defined below).

The establishment of pension funds for non-government employees is regulated by Law No. 4/2023 (as defined below) that provides for the establishment of two types of pension funds: employer pension funds, which are provided by a private employer to its employees, and financial institution pension funds, which are formed by a bank or insurance company that aims to manage pension funds for employees and self-employed who want to have a pension fund. In addition, the law and several government regulations and decrees specify the types of assets that these pension funds may acquire, as well as the permissible allocation of investments among assets and asset classes.

In November 2011, the Government enacted a law creating the Social Security Administering Agencies (Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial (“BPJS”)), i.e., Law No. 24 of 2011 on Social Security Administering Agencies (“Law No. 24 of 2011”). The BPJS consists of the (i) BPJS for Health Coverage (“ BPJS Kesehatan”), which provides healthcare services for all citizens and (ii) BPJS for Social Security Benefit for Workers (“BPJS Ketenagakerjaan”), which provides social security benefits for private sector and informal workers. BPJS Kesehatan and BPJS Ketenagakerjaan took over the functions of the Government’s other social security administering agencies, namely PT Askes (Persero) and PT Jamsostek (Persero), on January 1, 2014. In December 2022, Law No. 24 of 2011 was amended by the Law on Job Creation.

In order to implement the BPJS, PT Asabri (Persero) and PT Taspen (Persero) will assign: (i) the provision of healthcare benefits and pensions for police and armed forces to be administered by PT Asabri (Persero) and (ii) the provision of pensions and retirement benefits to be administered by PT Taspen (Persero) and BPJS Ketenagakerjaan. The assignments are expected to be completed by no later than 2029.

The Law on Job Creation and Law No. 24 of 2011 together amended Law No. 40 of 2004 on the National Social Security System by adding the Unemployment Benefits Program (Jaminan Kehilangan Pekerjaan (“JKP”)). Prior to the effectiveness of the Law on Job Creation, unemployment benefit was not a part of Indonesia’s social security program. Under Law of Job Creation and its implementing regulation, employers are mandated to register their employees in JKP program. The benefits include hard cash, access to job market information and job training, all of which are accessible in the event of employment termination.

Income Distribution

As of September 2024, Indonesia had a Gini Index of 0.381. The Gini Index is a measure of income distribution that ranges between 0.0 and 1.0, with higher numbers indicating greater inequality.

The percentage of people living below the poverty line in Indonesia has exhibited a decreasing trend since the Asian financial crisis in 1998. BPS measures poverty using a basic needs approach and defines poverty as an economic inability to fulfil food and non-food basic needs, measured by consumption and expenditure. Based on this methodology, approximately 49.5 million people, or 24.2% of the population, were living below the poverty line in 1998, and this decreased to approximately 24.1 million, or 8.6% of the population, as of September 2024.

Policy Package for Purchasing Power Protection and Economic Stabilization

The Government has been making efforts to alleviate poverty.

Amid high inflation, high interest rates, commodity price volatility and other economic uncertainties, the Government introduced in 2023 a policy package to protect the purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable population, support micro, small and medium enterprises (“MSMEs”) and strengthen the housing sector. The support measures include:

 	•
additional rice assistance of 10 kilograms per family for 21.3 million recipients in December 2023, and of 10 kilogram per family for 22.0 million recipients monthly from January to June 2024;

 	•
El Niño direct cash assistance of Rp200,000 per month for 18.8 million recipients for their basic necessities during November and December 2023;

 	•
accelerating the People’s Business Credit Program (Kredit Usaha Rakyat) to provide government-subsidized financing with low interest rates for MSMEs, for which the realization amount was Rp177.5 trillion by September 2023, with a target realization of Rp297 trillion by the end of 2023; and

 	•
fiscal stimulus for the housing sector in the form of VAT exemption/reduction for the first Rp2.0 billion for the purchase of houses priced below Rp5.0 billion from November 2023 to December 2024, administrative fee assistance of up to Rp4.0 million per house for low-income community houses from November 2023 to December 2024; and poor community house support of Rp20.0 million per house for 1,800 houses from November to December 2023.

Regional Growth

As the island with the highest population density, high consumption and an industrial base, Java has historically been the main contributor to Indonesia’s economic growth. In 2024, Java contributed 57.0% of Indonesia’s GDP, Sumatera contributed 22.1%, Kalimantan contributed 8.2%, Sulawesi contributed 7.1%, Bali and Nusa Tenggara contributed 2.8%, and Maluku and Papua contributed 2.7%. In the first quarter of 2025, Java contributed 57.4% of Indonesia’s GDP, Sumatera contributed 22.1%, Kalimantan contributed 8.1%, Sulawesi contributed 7.0%, Bali and Nusa Tenggara contributed 2.7%, and Maluku and Papua contributed 2.6%.

The Government allocates a portion of the state budget for transfers to regions and village funds each year. Transfers to regions and village funds has become one of the funding instruments for accelerated development programs and is an instrument to achieve national priority goals carried out by the regional government. This allocation plays a strategic role to support the performance of all regions in improving the quality of and equalizing basic public services, creating employment, alleviating poverty and improving equity in capacity inter-regional finance.

Through the implementation of Law No. 1 of 2022 on the Financial Relations between the Central Government and the Regional government, with respect to, among other things, budget allocation and deficit provisions), the Government allocates a portion of the state budget for transfers to regions and village funds each year. Transfers to regions and village funds have become one of the funding instruments for accelerated development programs and is an instrument to achieve national priority goals carried out by the regional government. This allocation plays a strategic role to support the performance of all regions in improving the quality of and equalizing basic public services, creating employment, alleviating poverty and improving equity in capacity inter-regional finance.

From 2020 to 2024, transfers to regions and village funds on average increased by 3.2% per year. The increase in transfers to the regions in recent years has been instrumental in improving delivery of basic public services in the area. For more information, see “ — Government Revenues and Expenditure.”

The Law on Job Creation

The “Law on Job Creation” refers to Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 2 of 2022 on Job Creation (“GR 2/2022”) together with Law No. 6 of 2023 on the Enactment of GR 2/2022 as Law (“Law 6/2023”).

On November 2, 2020, the President signed Law No. 11 of 2020 on Job Creation (“Law 11/2020”), an omnibus law that amended or revoked more than 70 existing laws and regulations. Law 11/2020 aims to increase investment in the country by (i) reducing and streamlining licensing requirements, (ii) reducing restrictions on foreign investments, (iii) creating a framework for incentivizing investments, (iv) amending employment laws and regulations, including changes to existing rules on employee termination, fixed-term employment and outsourcing, and (v) amending land and spatial planning laws. The Law on Job Creation provides for the establishment of an Indonesian sovereign wealth fund, the Nusantara Investment Authority, to attract foreign capital to invest in strategic sectors of the Indonesian economy, support sustainable development and boost economic growth. The Nusantara Investment Authority will have a two-tiered board, comprising a five-member supervisory board co-chaired by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of State-Owned Enterprises and a five-member independent board of directors.

Law 11/2020 mandates the issuance of implementing government regulations and presidential regulations that will significantly influence how the law is substantively implemented. The Government has since then issued a number of implementing regulations for the Law on Job Creation. The implementation of Law 11/2020 is carried out through the enactment of Government Regulation No. 5 of 2021 on the Implementation of Risk-Based Business Licensing (as partially revoked) (“GR 5/2021”), which regulates the business permit based on risk-based business licensing, the purpose of which is to improve the investment ecosystem and business activities to make it more effective and simpler as well as to oversee transparent, structured, and accountable business activities. Furthermore, for the purpose of the implementation of the GR 5/2021, the Government issued the Central Statistics Agency Regulation No. 2 of 2020, which regulates the new Standard Classification of Indonesian Business Fields (“KBLI”) 2020 and replaces the KBLI 2017. The business permit has to comply with the KBLI 2020, which is a standard reference, coordination, integration and synchronization of statistical operations.

The Government issued GR 2/2022 on December 30, 2022, effective the same day. This followed and was part of the responses to the Constitutional Court Decision No. 91/PUU-XVIII/2020 made in November 2021, which rendered Law 11/ 2020 conditionally unconstitutional and gave the Government two years, until November 2023, to amend the law. GR 2/2022 was enacted as law, effective March 31, 2023, by Law 6/2023. The Law on Job Creation replaces Law 11/2020. All implementing regulations of Law 11/2020 remain valid provided that they are not in contradictory to the Law on Job Creation.

In 2024, the Constitutional Court issued a ruling in response to a challenge of certain labor provisions in the Law on Job Creation, whereby the Constitutional Court ordered the Indonesian legislature to promptly draft and enact a new labor law, separating labor provisions from the Law on Job Creation. This new statute should specifically address labor issues, harmonize existing labor regulations, and resolve any contradictions with other laws.

GR 5/2021 was revoked and replaced by Government Regulation No. 28 of 2025 on the Implementation of Risk-Based Business Licensing (“GR 28/2025”), which became effective from June 5, 2025. GR 28/2025 maintains the same core objective as GR 5/2021, streamlining business licensing through a risk-based approach. It introduces clearer classifications of business risks, strengthens oversight by technical ministries and local governments, and enhances integration within the OSS system. Under GR 28/2025, the OSS system must be adjusted to align with the new provisions, and implementing regulations are mandated to be issued within four months from its effective date of June 5, 2025. These adjustments include expanded sectoral coverage, refined licensing stages, and more detailed prerequisites such as environmental and spatial approvals.

Infrastructure Development

A key priority of the Government is to encourage infrastructure development as a means to accelerate economic growth particularly in rural areas, support further industrial development and tourism, enhance urban transportation and improve the lives and economic welfare of Indonesians by reducing unemployment and poverty. National strategic projects (Proyek Strategis Nasional (“PSNs”)) are projects of strategic importance to promote economic growth, equitable development, job creation and advancement of national development plans. Substantially all the PSNs are infrastructure projects, with only a few exceptions, such as the Free Nutritious Meal Program, as described in “Government Budget — Free Nutritious Meal Program”. A project that is designated as a national strategic project will receive more attention from the Government through the grant of additional resources and completion on an expedited timeline.

National strategic projects are regulated through presidential regulations and implemented by the central and regional governments in coordination with BPI Danantara, SOEs and the private sector, prioritizing the use of domestic components. PSNs were first introduced in 2016. From 2016 to December 2024, a total of 229 PSNs had been completed, with total investment value of Rp1,993 trillion.

The PSN program currently comprises two groups of ongoing projects:

The first group comprises PSNs designated as such by the Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs in 2024, under the administration of President Joko Widodo. These initially included 228 projects and 16 programs, divided into five main categories by function and purpose:

 	(i)
basic infrastructure, such as dams and irrigation facilities, drinking water supply systems, airports, railways, and toll roads;

 	(ii)
regional development projects, such as tourism areas and eco-city areas;

 	(iii)
energy resilience projects, such as power plants, waste-to-energy plants, and transmission networks;

 	(iv)
industry downstreaming and investment projects, such as special economic zones, industrial zones, smelters, and agricultural and plantation projects; and

 	(v)
projects for strategic policies, such as food estates, merger of SOEs, agrarian reform, drone research, and multifunctional satellites.

As of December 2024, 114 of the projects in this first group had been completed.

The second group comprises PSNs under the 2025-2029 National Medium-Term Development Plan (“RPJMN 2025-2029”), which was enacted and published in February 2025. Under the RPJMN 2025-2029, 77 PSNs have been identified, including 47 projects carried over from the first group. The remaining 30 projects are new projects. The 77 PSNs in this second group comprise eight categories:

 	(i)
the Free Nutritious Meal Program (1 PSN);

 	(ii)
human development and culture, such as development of schools and construction of hospitals (5 PSNs);

 	(iii)
food self-sufficiency, such as construction and development food estate, irrigation services, fishing port and aquaculture (6 PSNs);

 	(iv)
water self-sufficiency, such as the giant sea wall on the north coast of Java and river dams (7 PSNs);

 	(v)
energy self-sufficiency, such as a hydropower plant, sugarcane-based bioethanol projects, biorefinery projects, oil refineries and urban gas networks (11 PSNs);

 	(vi)
downstreaming, industrialization and digital transformation, such as development of special economic zones, industrial estates, and downstream industries (35 PSNs);

 	(vii)
connectivity and regions, such as development of Nusantara, ports, and toll roads (9 PSNs); and

 	(viii)
housing and settlements, such as construction of national houses, and development of waste processing plants and Jakarta’s sewerage system (3 PSNs).

The ongoing PSNs represent long-term initiatives developed over the past decade and also include innovative programs and projects introduced under President Prabowo Subianto’s “Asta Cita” vision, which places a strong emphasis on human development. These ongoing PSNs have been fully integrated into national development planning documents and reflected in the 2026 Government Work Plan (Rencana Kerja Pemerintah).

The Government estimates that achieving its ambitious 8% economic growth rate by 2029 will require infrastructure investments totaling more than Rp10,000 trillion. This amount significantly exceeds the funding capacity of the public sector alone. As a result, the Government currently expects to pay for 40% of this cost using public sector funding (state budgets, SOEs and regional SOEs), with the balance coming private sector investment. The public sector funds would primarily be used to support basic infrastructure projects, food security (e.g., irrigation, dams) and transportation, logistics and connectivity projects as well as urban transportation.

The Government expects to finance the remaining cost of the priority infrastructure projects through greater private sector participation, specifically: partnerships between the Government and the private sector (i.e., private public partnerships (“PPPs”)), and increased borrowing by the Government and SOEs.

The Government recognizes the important role of PPPs in the development of infrastructure projects and has adopted regulations that provide the legal and regulatory framework for PPPs—from procurement of the PPP concessionaire to the provision of Government support and guarantees. For a discussion of these guarantees, see “—Public Debt—Contingent Liabilities from Government Guarantees” below.

Transportation-related projects

The transportation network on the Indonesian archipelago relies heavily on sea and air transportation compared to most other countries of comparable size. Most road networks in and around major cities are heavily congested, while many inter-urban and rural road networks are in poor condition and are in need of repair. Public funds for road maintenance and construction are insufficient, and the Government is encouraging private participation and investment in building toll roads, mostly in Java, Sumatera and Sulawesi.

In the railways sector, by 2030 the railway network is expected to cover 12,100 km and achieve passenger share of approximately 11.0%-13.0%, and freight transport share of approximately 15.0%-17.0%. In addition, the plan provides strategies for the Government to achieve its goals by 2030, such as strategies regarding railway network development, increasing security and safety, technology transfer and industrial development, human resources development, institutional development, investment and financing.

In addition, railway projects are expected to be developed in the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatera, West Sumatera, South Sumatera and South Sulawesi, as well as in Java and several urban railways in Jakarta, Bandung, Yogyakarta, Surabaya and Medan. The Government is also studying the feasibility of railway projects in Kalimantan and Papua and an elevated train and subway system in Jakarta.

Construction of the first phase of the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit (“MRT”), connecting Lebak Bulus to Bundaran Hotel Indonesia, commenced in 2013. Phase One constitutes approximately 15.7 km out of a total of approximately 23.8 km and was completed and operational in March 2019. Construction for the second phase of the Jakarta MRT, connecting Bundaran Hotel Indonesia to Kota Station and West Ancol has commenced.

Construction of the Light Rail Transit in South Sumatera and the Jakarta, Bogor, Depok and Bekasi region commenced in 2015. Construction in South Sumatera was completed in 2018. Construction in Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Bekasi and Cibubur was completed and commenced commercial operation in 2023.

Indonesia’s first high-speed railway, which connects Jakarta and Bandung, was constructed from 2016 to 2023 and commenced commercial operation in October 2023. In addition, two additional bus-way corridors have been developed and the construction of the remaining sections of the tolled ring road circling the outer city of Jakarta, the Jakarta Outer Ring Road, has been completed.

The RPJMN 2025-2029 maintains a strong emphasis on infrastructure, identifying 7 transportation PSNs for the period. Notable projects include the Jakarta Metropolitan MRT East-West Corridor, the Serang-Panimbang Toll Road, and the Probolinggo-Banyuwangi Toll Road. In addition, the Government has selected 20 cities for the development and enhancement of urban mass transit systems, incorporating both road-based and rail-based solutions. Sustainability remains a key emphasis, with recommendations to integrate a national roadmap for the electrification of urban public transportation into the RPJMN 2025-2029 to secure funding and guide implementation toward the national goal of electrifying 90% of urban public transport by 2030.

Energy-related projects

The RPJMN 2025-2029 aims to guide Indonesia toward a sustainable, green economy, aligning with the long-term goal of achieving net zero emissions. Recognizing the shortfall in the previous renewable energy target — where the share of renewables in the national energy mix reached only 14% instead of the intended 23% by 2025 — the new plan places a heightened emphasis on accelerating the adoption of renewable energy sources. This energy transition is not only viewed as an environmental imperative but also as a strategic economic opportunity to stimulate industrial growth, foster innovation, and enhance Indonesia’s global competitiveness.

Eleven energy-related PSNs have been included in the RPJMN 2025-2029. Key projects encompass the Tuban Oil Refinery, the development of biofuels from methanol and ethanol in Bojonegoro, the North Hub Development Project in the Makassar Strait, the establishment of a biorefinery in Cilacap, and the expansion of the urban gas distribution networks. These projects are intended to enhance Indonesia’s energy self-sufficiency, diversify the country’s energy portfolio, and support the broader transition to cleaner energy.

Securing adequate financing for these undertakings will be challenging. The Government is prioritizing regulatory reforms and the creation of risk-sharing mechanisms to attract greater private sector and foreign investment.

For further information on Indonesia’s energy security and environmental policies, see “Land and People — Energy Security” and “Land and People — Environment.”

Telecommunications

The Government aims to reduce the digital divide between rural and urban areas. One Government initiative to achieve this reduction is to implement the Universal Service Obligation (“USO”), which aims at providing broadband access to villages in non-commercial areas using facilities placed in schools, community health centers, or rural government offices.

Due to the importance of broadband network access to the improvement of economic growth, the Government introduced the Indonesia Broadband Plan (“IBP”), which consists of a policy document and an implementation plan. The policy document outlines Indonesia’s current broadband ecosystem, the use of broadband as a strategy to improve Indonesia’s competitiveness, and the policies and strategies for developing Indonesia’s broadband. The implementation plan includes a detailed action plan for the broadband infrastructure project and its development.

One of the Government’s major projects in telecommunication is the Palapa Ring Broadband project. This Rp21 trillion (U.S.$1.55 billion) project comprises three sections, west, central and east, and will span 13,000 kilometers. It aims to construct a broadband network across Indonesia’s 57 cities, as well as in frontier, outermost and remote regions. In July 2017, telecommunication developer PT Palapa Timur Telematika commenced the construction of a broadband network in eastern Indonesia under the Palapa Ring Broadband project, which was completed in October 2019.

Under the RPJMN 2020-2024, one of the Strategic Priority Projects is information, communication and technology infrastructure to support digital transformation, to reduce the digital gap and provide fast internet services to support the digitization of the economic, social and government sectors. The RPJMN 2020-2024 also laid out the policies and target for the development and utilization of information, communication and technology infrastructure, including improving fixed and mobile broadband network coverage, increasing population served by digital broadcasting and facilitating new start-up unicorns.

Under the RPJMN 2025-2029, Indonesia’s telecommunications strategy will transition from providing basic telecommunication access to delivering “meaningful connectivity” with a focus on quality, equity, and utilization to drive economic growth. The plan targets an increase in average mobile broadband speeds to 100 Mbps by 2029 through new spectrum allocation and efficient infrastructure sharing models. Beyond infrastructure development, the Government committed to developing a more robust digital ecosystem by prioritizing the cultivation of a skilled digital workforce, enhancing data governance via national data centers, and integrating digital technology with traditional economic sectors. The Government expects the new capital, Nusantara, to serve as a national model for advanced digital services, setting a benchmark for future smart cities in Indonesia.

Progress on the Development of Nusantara

In August 2019, President Widodo announced plans to move Indonesia’s capital from Jakarta to an area in East Kalimantan province on the island on the island of Kalimantan, named Nusantara. The proposed move has been authorized under Law No. 3 of 2022 on Capital City (as amended by Law No. 21 of 2023 on the Amendment of Law No. 3 of 2022 on Capital City) (“Law 3/2022”).

The development of Nusantara is planned in five phases starting in 2022 and ending in 2045, as outlined in the Government’s master plan for the development of the new capital included in Presidential Regulation No. 63 of 2022 (the “Master Plan”). According to the Master Plan, Phase I is the construction of basic infrastructure such as main roads and core public transportation infrastructure, IT, electricity, and water supply; Phase II focuses on the development of mixed-use areas to accommodate business and industrial districts, educational and tourism facilities, as well as advanced IT infrastructure and additional facilities to support the target population; Phase III focuses on the development of mass transportation infrastructure, expansion of waste and water infrastructure and businesses and industries; Phase IV focuses on the development of infrastructure and ecosystems for three cities (i.e., Nusantara, Balikpapan and Samarinda), to accelerate Kalimantan’s overall development; and Phase V, the final phase, which is targeted to be completed within the 2040-2045 period, focuses on developing mass public transport and integrated infrastructure and utilities, promoting zero carbon emissions and 100% renewable energy, fostering sustainable industrial development, and turning Nusantara into an internationally competitive city.

As of July 2025, the physical work for the basic infrastructure for the core area of Nusantara had reached approximately 95% completion. In particular, construction has been completed for a number of key facilities, including the Presidential Palace and ceremonial grounds, office buildings for various ministries and the Nusantara Capital Authority, Taman Kusuma Bangsa (a public park), certain hospitals, 36 housing units designated for ministerial positions, a piped water supply and distribution system, the Sepaku Semoi Dam, and 27 apartment towers for civil servants and security personnel.

By the end of 2024, Nusantara had attracted a total of Rp65 trillion in investment by private sector and state-owned enterprises. Additionally, from 2022 to 2024, the infrastructure development in Nusantara was supported by state budget of Rp89 trillion.

President Prabowo Subianto has directed that Nusantara be prepared to serve as the political capital from 2028, with supporting infrastructure — including buildings for the executive, legislative, and judiciary branches — completed by that time. To support this plan, the Government estimates that the total funding required for Nusantara’s development from 2025 to 2029 will amount to Rp407.6 trillion. Of this amount, a state budget of Rp48.8 trillion has been allocated for the construction of office buildings, residential facilities for the judiciary and legislative bodies, development of supporting ecosystems, and the construction of specific roads; meanwhile, the Nusantara Capital Authority is seeking additional state funding. The remaining funding needs are expected to be met through public-private partnerships, private investment, and multilateral funding sources.

The development of Nusantara is designated as a PSN under the RPJMN 2025-2029, aligning with Phase II of the Master Plan. The Government will continue the relocation of civil servants to Nusantara, and advancement of 12 fundamental sectors, including renewable energy, telecommunication networks, transportation, housing, water treatment, waste management, technological infrastructure, commercial infrastructure, health facilities, social and public facilities, educational facilities, and green industrial estates. With investments in renewable energy (e.g., a 50 MW solar power plant), green transportation (e.g., electric bus rapid transit), and digital infrastructure, the Government hopes that Nusantara will ultimately serve as a model for sustainable urban development.

Affordable Housing Program

The Government has launched an affordable housing program for the construction or renovation of residential units in urban, rural, and coastal areas. The program is designated as a PSN under the RPJMN 2025-2029. The primary focus is to address the significant housing backlog and to provide decent, affordable housing for the country’s low-income population.

The program is structured to meet the diverse needs of Indonesia’s rapidly urbanizing society, as well as to support rural and coastal communities where housing deficits and substandard living conditions are acute. In urban areas, the initiative emphasizes the development of vertical housing, to maximize land use and improve access to employment and public services. In rural and coastal regions, the program leverages local contractors, MSMEs, cooperatives, and village-owned enterprises to construct homes that are adapted to local conditions and cultural wisdom, thereby fostering community participation and job creation.

To ensure affordability, the Government is implementing a range of financing schemes, including (i) the Low Income Subsidized Mortgage Program (Fasilitas Likuiditas Pembiayaan Perumahan), which provides interest subsidies and financial support and (ii) the Public Housing Savings (Tabungan Perumahan Rakyat) program, a mandatory housing savings program for the country’s private sector and SOE employees and armed forces and police personnel.

Foreign Investment

Foreign investment in Indonesia is primarily governed under Law No.25 of 2007 on Capital Investment (as partially amended by Law on Job Creation) (the “2007 Investment Law”). Pursuant to 2007 Investment Law, the Government has enacted a list of among others (i) sectors that are restricted for any investment and (ii) sectors that are open for investment with certain requirements (e.g. maximum foreign ownership or limited to certain locations) by issuing a presidential regulation. Any sector that is not included in the list is open for foreign investment without restriction.

As part of the implementing regulations to the Law on Job Creation, in 2021, the government enacted a new investment list. The new investment list notably reduces a considerable number of sectors that are open for investment with certain requirements, from previously 350 sectors to 46 sectors. Sectors that are not listed are generally fully open for any investment (domestic or foreign investment) without any ownership restriction/limitation.

With the issuance of GR 28/2025, as part of the Government’s ease of doing business initiative, the Government, among other things, launched the OSS system and changed the applicable licensing policy from a “pre-approval” regime to a “post evaluation” regime. These initiatives are also applicable to foreign investments.

The 2007 Investment Law provides certain tax incentives such as income tax deductions and certain deductions or exemptions with respect to import duties and value added tax on purchases of capital goods and raw materials. These tax incentives are granted in accordance with prevailing tax laws and regulations. Examples of tax incentives to attract foreign investment include import duty exemption on machinery, equipment, raw materials, and strategic goods, and VAT exemption on domestic purchases of production machinery. Additionally, tax holidays or reductions are available to businesses operating in peer industries (i.e., an industry with wide-ranging links that give added value, promotes new technology, and possesses strategic values for the national economy), or located in special economic zones or the new national capital of Nusantara, provided that the criteria under the specific tax schemes are satisfied. To date, tax holidays have been granted to 275 investments, of which 222 are foreign direct investments, and tax allowance has been granted to 152 investments, of which 78 are foreign direct investments. Moreover, the Government also provides super tax deduction for research and development activities and vocational training activities. See “Government Budget — Government Finances — Tax Incentive Policies” for more information on tax incentives.

The Government has also taken other measures to attract more foreign investment, including acceleration of licensing process, provision of financing facilities by Indonesia Eximbank to exporters, establishment of special economic zones and bonded areas, and signing of tax treaties and trade agreements. See “Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments — Membership in International and Regional Free Trade Agreements” for more information on Indonesia’s trade agreements.

Foreign Investment in Indonesia

Foreign investment in Indonesia is divided into direct investments, portfolio investments and other investments, and information about these types of investments is included in the Republic’s reports on its balance of payments published by the Bank Indonesia. Due to the different concept and method of compiling investment statistics, foreign direct investment statistical data published by Bank Indonesia are not comparable to the “administrative” foreign direct investment statistical data published by the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board (Badan Koordinasi Penanaman Modal (“BKPM”)) under “Direct Investments Realizations.”

The following table sets out the amounts of foreign investments in Indonesia by non-residents.

In 2020, despite the exceptional global financial market uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, net foreign direct investment was maintained at U.S.$19.2 billion, down from U.S.$25.0 billion in 2019. Foreign direct investment inflows in 2020 were primarily attributable to a net inflow of equity capital relating to the acquisition of a domestic bank by a company from Thailand and in the form of debt instruments relating to global bond issuances by mining companies through foreign affiliates. The financial intermediaries and manufacturing sectors were still the main contributors to net foreign direct investment inflows in 2020. ASEAN countries were the main contributors to foreign direct investment inflows, followed by China and other Asian emerging markets.

In the middle of rapid transmission of the highly virulent Delta variant, net foreign direct investment amassed a higher U.S.$21.2 billion surpluses in 2021 compared to U.S.$19.2 billion in 2020, primarily stemming from a higher net inflow of equity capital. Debt instruments also recorded a net inflow, reversing deficit in the previous year. A higher net inflow on equity capital was primarily driven by foreign capital investment in domestic courier companies, mining, manufacturing and financial intermediaries. The manufacturing sector dominated foreign direct investment inflows in 2021, followed by transportation, storage and communication, and mining and quarrying sectors. Meanwhile, emerging Asia (including China) and ASEAN were the major contributors to the foreign direct investment inflows in 2021.

Foreign direct investment maintained a surplus totaling U.S.$24.7 billion in 2022, primarily in the form of equity capital, representing an increase of 16.4% from a U.S.$21.2 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to increases of investment in manufacturing, transportation, storage, and communication, as well as construction, which are in line with the Government’s reform measures to develop downstream processing industries and to upgrade industrial capabilities to increase the added value of exports. With respect to country of origin, the increase was primarily due to increases of investment from Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea. The manufacturing, transportation, storage, and communication, financial intermediaries and trade sectors were the main contributors to net foreign direct investment inflows in 2022. With respect to country of origin, investors from Asian emerging markets (including the People’s Republic of China) were the main contributors to net foreign direct investment inflows, followed by ASEAN countries.

Foreign direct investment maintained a surplus totaling U.S.$21.9 billion in 2023, primarily in the form of equity capital, representing a decrease of 11.4% from a U.S.$24.7 billion surplus in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to decreases of investment in transportation, storage and communication as well as financial intermediaries, partially offset by increases of investment in manufacturing. With respect to country of origin, the decrease was primarily due to decreases of investment from Singapore, the United Kingdom and the People’s Republic of China, partially offset by increases of investment from Germany, Hong Kong SAR and Thailand.

The manufacturing, transportation, storage, and communication, as well as trade sectors were the main contributors to net foreign direct investment inflows in 2023. With respect to country of origin, investors from Asian emerging markets (including the People’s Republic of China) were the main contributors to net foreign direct investment inflows, followed by ASEAN countries.

Foreign direct investment recorded a surplus totalling U.S.$24.1 billion in 2024, primarily in the form of equity capital, representing a 12.0% increase from a U.S.$21.5 billion surplus in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher investment in health and social work, trade, and mining and quarrying, partially offset by lower investment in real estate and manufacturing. With respect to the country of origin, increased investment from Singapore and the United Kingdom was the main driver of the higher foreign direct investment in 2024.

The manufacturing, trade as well as health and social work sectors were the main contributors to net foreign direct investment inflows in 2024. With respect to country of origin, investors from Singapore were the main contributors to net foreign direct investment inflows, followed by those from Hong Kong SAR, the People’s Republic of China, South Korea and Japan.

Foreign direct investment recorded a surplus of U.S.$4.2 billion in the first quarter of 2025, primarily in the form of equity capital. This amount represents a 35.6% decrease from the U.S.$6.5 billion surplus recorded in the first quarter of 2024. The decline was primarily attributable to lower investment in the trade, financial intermediaries, and electricity, gas and water supply sectors. By country of origin, decrease in foreign director investment was largely driven by lower investment from Singapore and Japan.

The manufacturing, transportation, storage, and communication, and real estate sectors were the main contributors to net foreign direct investment inflows in the first quarter of 2025. With respect to country of origin, investment from Hong Kong was the largest contributor to the net foreign direct investment inflows, followed by the investments from People’s Republic of China and South Korea.

In 2020, foreign capital inflows in the form of portfolio investments were U.S.$4.6 billion, lower than the U.S.$21.6 billion recorded in 2019. Elevated financial market uncertainty caused by global and domestic factors, especially in the first quarter of 2020 has contributed to limited foreign fund placements in the government bond market and higher net outflows in the stock market, resulting in lower net foreign capital inflows to Indonesia.

After recording a surplus of U.S.$4.6 billion in 2020, portfolio investment achieved a higher surplus of U.S.$6.9 billion in 2021, predominantly driven by a larger net inflow in the first half of 2021. For the year, the stronger performance of the stock market bolstered portfolio investment inflow in line with the accelerated domestic economic growth achieved in 2021, thus maintaining non-resident investor confidence in the Indonesian economic outlook.

In 2022, foreign capital flows in the form of portfolio investments in Indonesia recorded a net outflow of U.S.$6.6 billion, compared to a net inflow of U.S.$6.9 billion in 2021. The increasing global financial market uncertainty triggered the rebalancing of domestic government securities (Surat Berharga Negara (“SBN”)) to other instruments, thus reducing the portion of non-resident holdings of domestic SBN. Capital inflows to the stock market remained positive, though lower than the previous year.

In 2023, foreign capital flows in the form of portfolio investments in Indonesia recorded a net inflow of U.S.$5.1 billion, compared to the net outflow of U.S.$6.6 billion in 2022. The net inflow comprise predominantly long-term instruments such as SBN denominated in Rupiah, as well as the newly introduced instrument Bank Indonesia Rupiah Securities (Sekuritas Rupiah Bank Indonesia (“SRBI”)).

In 2024, foreign capital flows in the form of portfolio investments in Indonesia recorded a net inflow of U.S.$12.2 billion, compared to the net inflow of U.S.$5.1 billion in 2023. The net inflow was mainly driven by foreign capital inflow in the form of SRBI and Government securities issued in international markets.

In the first quarter of 2025, foreign capital flows in the form of portfolio investments in Indonesia recorded a net inflow of U.S.$1.5 billion, compared to the net outflow of U.S.$0.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The net inflow was mainly driven by foreign capital inflow in the form of SRBI and Government securities issued in both domestic and international markets.

Consists of loans of public sector and trade credit, currency and deposits, SDR allocations, and other liabilities of private sector and public sector.

In 2020, other foreign investments decreased from a surplus of U.S.$6.1 billion in 2019 to a surplus of U.S.$2.3 billion. The decreased surplus was primarily due to lower loan withdrawal and a net payment on trade credit of private sector.

In 2021, other foreign investments fell from a surplus of U.S.$2.3 billion in 2020 to a deficit of U.S.$0.7 billion. The deficit was primarily due to net payments of foreign loans by both the public and private sectors (banking and corporate sector).

In 2022, other foreign investments increased from a deficit of U.S.$0.7 billion in 2021 to a surplus of U.S.$0.2 billion. The surplus in 2022 is primarily due to net drawings of foreign loans by the government and banking sector.

In 2023, other foreign investments increased from a surplus of U.S.$0.2 billion in 2022 to a surplus of U.S.$2.9 billion. The increase is primarily attributable to net drawings of foreign loans by the government and corporate sector.

In 2024, other foreign investments increased from a surplus of U.S.$4.4 billion in 2023 to a surplus of U.S.$10.1 billion. The surplus is primarily due to net drawings of foreign loans by the Government and the banking sector.

In the first quarter of 2025, other foreign investments decreased from a surplus of U.S.$1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2024 to a surplus of U.S.$0.5 billion. The surplus is primarily attributable to net drawings of foreign loans by the corporate and the Government sector.

Direct Investment Realizations

Foreign Direct Investment

In 1973, the Republic established BKPM, an investment services agency of the Government, to accelerate economic growth by attracting foreign capital investment. BKPM’s main function is to implement the Government’s objectives for investment in the country.

Under Indonesian law, most direct equity investments by foreign persons are subject to approval by the BKPM, regardless of the size of the investment. The BKPM reviews applications for approval based on the list of sectors that are open for investment under the Law on Job Creation, which lists those business sectors that are closed to foreign investment and those that are open to foreign investment subject to certain conditions, including limits on the percentage of foreign capital ownership; and also based on criteria established by the particular ministry that regulates the sector in which the foreign investor seeks to invest. Upon receiving approval, a foreign investor may complete the investment, but is not obligated to do so.

Due to the different concept and method of compiling investment statistics, “administrative” foreign direct investment statistical data published by the BKPM and “Balance of Payment” foreign direct investment statistical data published by Bank Indonesia are not comparable. BKPM calculates foreign direct investment based on realized investments in Indonesian companies owned by foreign investors within a certain reporting period. BKPM’s realization data covers the total value of investments funded by foreign investors, other foreign creditors, as well as domestic investors and creditors. In comparison, Bank Indonesia’s calculation method covers the entire flow of investments stemming from foreign investors over a certain reporting period. In addition, Bank Indonesia excludes from its calculations foreign investments made by investors with a non-resident ownership of less than 10% per individual investors while BKPM has no such minimum ownership requirement. In terms of sector coverage, BKPM excludes certain sectors from its calculation, including investments in oil and gas, banking, non-bank financial institutions, insurance, leasing, investment sectors licensed by technical/sectoral agencies, investments through the stock market and household investments. Bank Indonesia covers all economic sectors. As a result the data regarding realized foreign direct investments is not comparable to those under “Foreign Investment in Indonesia” in the table above.

The following table sets forth the amount of realized foreign direct investment by sector of the economy for the periods indicated.

Foreign Trade and Balance of Payments

Membership in International and Regional Free Trade Agreements

The Government supports the liberalization of international trade and investment through its membership in several international and regional trade organizations. Indonesia is a signatory to the GATT 1947 and a founding member of the World Trade Organization through the ratification of Law No. 7 of 1994 on Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. In 2017, the Government ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement through Law No. 17 of 2017 on Ratification of Protocol Amending the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization.

ASEAN has served as the forum for the negotiation of a number of regional agreements, and in 2015, ASEAN leaders adopted the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025, which is a roadmap for strategic integration of the economies of the ASEAN Member States. In 2009, the ASEAN Member States also entered into the ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement which aims to create a free and open regime in ASEAN to achieve economic integration. ASEAN Member States have entered into eight free trade agreements, namely: the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement, the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement, the ASEAN-Korea Free Trade Agreement, the ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the ASEAN-India Free Trade Agreement, the ASEAN-Australia and New Zealand Free Trade Agreement, the ASEAN-Hong Kong, China Free Trade Agreement, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. In addition, Indonesia has entered into and implemented nine bilateral trade agreements and two multilateral trade agreements: the Indonesia-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, the Indonesia-Pakistan Preferential Trade Agreement, the Indonesia-Chile Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the Indonesia-Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the Indonesia-United Arab Emirates Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the Indonesia-Mozambique Preferential Trade Agreement, the Indonesia-Palestina MOU on Trade Facilitation for Certain Products, the Indonesia-Iran Preferential Trade Agreement, the Indonesia-EFTA Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, and the Preferential Trade Agreement Among Developing Eight. These free trade agreements cover three core areas, namely: trade in goods, trade in services and investments.

In addition, the Indonesia-European Free Trade Association Comprehensive Economic Partnership was signed in 2018 and entered into force in November 2021. It covers trade in goods and services, investments, intellectual property rights, government procurement, cooperation, capacity building, and sustainable development.

Various regional and bilateral free trade agreements of which Indonesia is a party are currently in different stages of negotiations, namely, the Indonesia-European Union Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the Indonesia-Canada Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the Indonesia-Bangladesh Preferential Trade Agreement, the Indonesia-Peru Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, the Indonesia-Eurasian Economic Union Free Trade Agreement, the Indonesia-Tunisia Preferential Trade Agreement, the Indonesia-Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement, the Indonesia-Türkiye Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and the Indonesia-Sri Lanka Preferential Trade Agreement.

The Minister of Finance is authorized to set rates for import duties. The Republic maintains a policy of using tariff rates to promote the competitiveness of Indonesian products in international markets and to reduce price distortions in order to support the establishment of free trade. The Republic has implemented preferential tariff commitments under its various international and regional free trade agreements.

United States Tariffs

On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. Government would impose a 10% tariff on all countries, effective April 5, 2025. Additionally, the U.S. Government announced the imposition of individualized reciprocal higher tariffs on specific countries, including a 32% tariff on goods imported from Indonesia, initially set to take effect on April 9, 2025, but later delayed. On April 9, 2025, President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the individualized reciprocal higher tariff on almost all countries, including Indonesia. This pause was further extended, the 32% tariff has been postponed beyond its originally planned implementation date of August 1, 2025, following high-level talks between Indonesian and US officials on July 9, 2025.

The Republic has refrained from retaliatory trade measures and has actively pursued negotiations with the U.S. government. During the IMF-World Bank Spring Meeting held in Washington D.C. in April 2025, the Indonesian delegation, led by the Coordinating Minister of Economic Affairs, held bilateral meetings with the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury and also engaged with other key US authorities. In addition, on July 7, 2025, Indonesian businesses signed a U.S.$34 billion trade and investment pact with their U.S. counterparts to increase imports and investments from the U.S. into Indonesia, aiming to secure a better tariff deal for the Republic. On July 15, 2025, the US and Indonesia announced a new trade agreement, reducing the proposed tariff on Indonesian imports to 19%. The new tariff rate is expected to take effect on August 1, 2025, replacing the previously proposed 32% tariff.

The higher tariffs could have a negative effect on certain of the Republic’s key export sectors and lead to lower economic growth.

Negotiation on Free Trade Agreement between Indonesia and the European Union

On July 13, 2025, the Republic and the European Union reached a political agreement to advance a free trade agreement known as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (“CEPA”), marking a milestone after nine years of negotiation since the official launch in 2016. The CEPA is designed to promote trade and investment, foster inclusive and sustainable growth and enhance the resilience of supply chain.

P
Preliminary.

In 2020, Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of U.S.$21.3 billion, reversed from the U.S.$5.0 billion deficit in 2019. The trade surplus was caused by an 18.1% decrease in imports, which was greater than the 3.0% decrease in exports. A greater import contraction affected all commodity groups in response to severely impaired domestic economic activity, curbed by mobility restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as an export contraction recorded in 2020.

In 2021, Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of U.S.$34.0 billion, which increased from the U.S.$21.3 billion surplus recorded in 2020. The higher trade surplus was caused by a 42.5% increase in exports, which was higher than the 39.9% increase in imports, each compared to the previous year. Exports expanded at a higher rate compared to 2020, given stronger demand and higher export prices in 2021, which is in line with the global economic recovery. Increasing prices of Indonesia’s major commodities such as coal and palm oil has boosted exports throughout 2021.

In 2022, Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of U.S.$50.8 billion, which increased by 49.3% from the U.S.$34.0 billion surplus in 2021. The higher trade surplus was caused by a 25.6% year-on-year increase in exports, which was higher than the 21.6% year-on-year increase in imports (c.i.f). The improvement of export performance was mainly due to persistently high international commodity prices and robust demand for Indonesian major commodities. Consistent with stronger exports, imports also experienced an uptick compared to 2021 as the domestic economy continues to recover.

In 2023, Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of U.S.$35.5 billion, which decreased by 30.2% from the U.S.$50.8 billion surplus in 2022. The lower trade surplus was mainly due to a 11.3% decrease in exports primarily due to softening demand from Indonesia’s major trading partners for its main non-oil and gas export commodities as well as decreasing commodity prices. In addition, imports (c.i.f) decreased by 7.3%, in line with export performance.

In 2024, Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of U.S.$28.1 billion, which decreased by 20.7% from the U.S.$35.4 billion surplus in 2023. The lower trade surplus was primarily driven by a 5.2% year-on-year increase in imports in line with solid domestic demand. Meanwhile, exports grew by 1.6% year-on-year, supported by higher international commodity prices.

In the five months of 2025, Indonesia recorded a trade surplus of U.S.$14.2 billion, which increased by 22.0% from the U.S.$11.6 billion surplus in the same period of 2024. The higher surplus was driven by a 6.6% year-on-year increase in exports, supported by rising international commodity prices. This increase was partially offset by a 4.7% year-on-year increase in imports.

Export-Import Data from the Central Statistics Agency

In addition to the exports and imports related data published by Bank Indonesia, the Central Statistics Agency or BPS also publishes data relating to imports and exports compiled based on the International Merchandise Trade Statistics Manual issued by the United Nations. Due to the different methods and timing of compiling export-import statistics, the export-import data published by BPS is different to the export-import data published by Bank Indonesia.

The tables below show Indonesia’s exports and imports for the periods indicated as published by the BPS.

Government Regulation of Export Proceeds

The Government Regulation Number 36 Year 2023 on Foreign Exchange Export Earnings from the Business, Management and/or Processing of Natural Resources (as amended, “GR 36/2023”), effective August 1, 2023, was recently amended by Government Regulation Number 8 Year 2025. Under GR 36/2023, all export proceeds from certain mining, plantation, forestry, and fisheries products must be deposited in special accounts at the Indonesian Export Finance Agency (currently Indonesia Eximbank) or a licensed foreign-exchange bank and retained in the Indonesian banking system for at least 12 months from the date of deposit.

Export proceeds from oil and gas products are subject to a different rule mandating that at least 30% of such proceeds must remain in the Indonesian banking system for a minimum of three months following their deposit into special accounts at Indonesia Eximbank or a licensed foreign-exchange bank.

Exporters are permitted to utilize the export proceed held in these special accounts as collateral for Rupiah-denominated bank loans or credit facilities from Indonesia Eximbank or a licensed foreign-exchange bank, or for such other purpose as may be approved by Bank Indonesia.

Ban on Raw Material Exports

The Government has banned exports of bauxite ore since June 2023. It has also banned exports of copper concentrate since the same month, with an exemption for Freeport Indonesia and Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara to continue such exports until May 2024. These bans, together with the Government’s ban on exports of nickel ore since January 2020, are part of the Republic’s efforts to encourage the domestic processing of raw materials and reduce its reliance on imports of processed materials.

Temporary Ban on Palm Oil and Other Products

On April 28, 2022, the Government implemented a temporary ban on export of Indonesian (i) crude palm oil, (ii) bleached and deodorized palm oil, (iii) refined, bleached, and deodorized palm olein, and (iv) used cooking oil, to the global market. The policy was aimed at maintaining the domestic stock and reducing the scarcity of palm-based cooking oil in the domestic Indonesian market. As a result, the Government has stabilized the stock and lower the palm-based cooking oil price in the domestic market. In May 2022, the Government revoked the ban and permitted the export of (i) crude palm oil, (ii) bleached and deodorized palm oil, (iii) refined, bleached, and deodorized palm olein, and (iv) used cooking oil.

Balance of Payments

Balance of payments figures measure the relative flow of goods, services and capital into and out of a country as represented in the current account and the capital and financial account. The current account tracks a country’s trade in goods and services, as well as income and current transfer transactions. The capital and financial account covers all transactions involving capital transfers, acquisition or disposal of non-produced, non-financial assets, and financial assets and liabilities. A balance of payments surplus indicates a net inflow of foreign currencies, while a balance of payments deficit indicates a net outflow of foreign currencies.

The following table sets forth the Republic’s balance of payments for the periods indicated.

(1)
Bank Indonesia uses (+) and (-) signs in its published data to follow BPM5 whereby (+) means inflow and (-) means outflow. In financial account, (+) denotes increase in liabilities or decrease in assets, while (-) represents increase in assets or decrease in liabilities. The table above has been adjusted to align with the formatting hereof.

(2)
The calculation of export and import figures included in the balance of payments data compiled by Bank Indonesia differs in coverage and timing from the data on export/import trade compiled by BPS.

Presents the position of reserve assets at the end of period. A change in the overall balance of payments during a reporting period will affect the outstanding amount of reserve assets at the end of that period.

In 2020, the current account deficit decreased considerably to U.S.$4.4 billion compared to a U.S.$30.3 billion deficit in 2019. The lower current account deficit was primarily due to higher goods trade surplus and lower primary income deficit. The higher goods trade surplus in 2020 was driven by rapid growth of the non-oil and gas trade surplus coupled with a narrower oil and gas trade deficit. In addition, lower primary income deficit in line with the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic coupled with exceptional global financial market uncertainty, which fed through to deteriorating corporate performance and lower foreign capital inflows in the form of direct investment, portfolio investment and other investment. On the other hand, the services trade deficit recorded a wider deficit which was primarily caused by reduction in the travel services trade surplus due to a precipitous decline of international and domestic travelers caused by closed borders and mobility restrictions to prevent Covid-19 transmission.

The capital and financial account surplus decreased to U.S.$7.9 billion in 2020 compared to a U.S.$36.6 billion surplus in 2019, primarily due to a net outflow of portfolio investment at the beginning of the year in response to global financial market panic stoked by rapid Covid-19 transmission around the world. Hence, Indonesia’s overall balance of payments in 2020 recorded a surplus of U.S.$2.6 billion. The position of international reserves assets at the end of 2020 were U.S.$135.9 billion, increased from U.S.$129.2 billion at the end of 2019.

In 2021, the current account reversed to a surplus of U.S.$3.5 billion compared to a U.S.$4.4 billion deficit in 2020. The current account improvements were primarily supported by a significantly larger goods trade surplus compared with conditions one year earlier due to non-oil and gas export performance. Exports of all major commodities improved in 2021, boosted by stronger export demand and higher prices. In addition, the secondary income account surplus also increased as compared to the previous year, which contributed to the current account surplus in 2021.

Notwithstanding the uncertainties in the global financial markets due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the capital and financial account increased to a surplus of U.S.$12.6 billion in 2021, mainly due to long-term capital inflows from foreign direct investments and portfolio investments of the private sector. Hence, Indonesia’s overall balance of payments in 2021 recorded a surplus of U.S.$13.5 billion. The position of international reserves assets at the end of 2021 were U.S.$144.9 billion, increased from U.S.$135.9 billion at the end of 2020.

The current account recorded a U.S.$13.2 billion surplus in 2022, higher than the U.S.$3.5 billion surplus recorded in 2021. This was primarily supported by higher exports in line with the increased international commodity prices and robust demand for several Indonesian commodities such as coal, iron and steel, and metalliferous ores, with imports also rising to fuel the domestic economic improvements. On the other hand, the services trade balance deficit widened as public mobility increased and domestic economic recovery accelerated. The primary income deficit also increased in response to the higher investment income payments on direct investment, which was in line with corporate performance improvements.

The capital and financial account recorded a U.S.$8.7 billion deficit in 2022, reversing a U.S.$12.6 billion surplus in 2021, amidst the higher global financial market uncertainty. Direct investment surplus increased in 2022, reflecting investor views in the domestic economic outlook and domestic investment climate of Indonesia. Meanwhile, portfolio investment recorded a deficit, mainly due to outflow in the domestic SBN market in line with the increasing global financial market uncertainty amid ongoing measures in various economies to tighten monetary policy more aggressively. Other investments also recorded a deficit due to private investments in several financial instruments abroad and net payments of private sector external debt.

As a result of the foregoing, Indonesia’s balance of payments in 2022 booked a U.S.$4.0 billion surplus, compared to the U.S.$13.5 billion surplus in 2021. The official reserve assets was U.S.$137.2 billion as at December 31, 2022, compared to U.S.$144.9 billion as at December 31, 2021.

In 2023, the current account recorded a deficit of U.S.$1.9 billion, after registering a U.S.$13.2 billion surplus in 2022. These developments were mainly influenced by a lower goods trade surplus in line with global economic moderation and lower commodity prices, coupled with steady domestic demand. On the other hand, the services trade deficit narrowed in line with a surge of inbound international travelers as the tourism sector continued to recover.

The capital and financial account in 2023 improved, registering a U.S.$10.0 billion surplus compared to the U.S.$8.7 billion deficit in 2022, supported by surpluses in both direct investment and portfolio investment despite global financial market uncertainty. A conducive investment climate and investors’ view with respect to domestic economic outlook maintained direct investment inflows to Indonesia. In addition, portfolio inflows recorded a surplus despite global financial market uncertainty. Relatively high yields on domestic financial assets for investment and the introduction of new financial instruments issued by Bank Indonesia further bolstered portfolio investment surplus.

As a result of the foregoing, Indonesia’s balance of payments in 2023 booked a U.S.$6.3 billion surplus, an increase from the U.S.$4.0 billion surplus in 2022. The official reserve assets as at December 31, 2023 increased to U.S.$146.4 billion from U.S.$137.2 billion as at December 31, 2022.

In 2024, the current account recorded a deficit of U.S.$8.5 billion, an increase from the U.S.$2.0 billion deficit recorded in 2023. This was primarily due to a decrease in the non-oil and gas trade balance surplus as demand from Indonesia’s main trading partners weakened, while Indonesia’s domestic demand remained strong.

In 2024, the capital and financial account recorded a U.S.$17.5 billion surplus, an increase from the U.S.$9.9 billion surplus in 2023. The higher surplus was supported by foreign capital inflows in the form of direct investment and portfolio investment, despite ongoing uncertainty in global financial markets. Direct investment continued to book a surplus, reflecting positive investor sentiment towards Indonesia’s economic outlook. Additionally, public sector portfolio investment inflow increased, driven by foreign investment in SRBI and the Government’s issuance of bonds and sukuk in international markets.

As a result of the foregoing, Indonesia’s balance of payments in 2024 booked a U.S.$7.2 billion surplus, larger than the U.S.$6.3 billion surplus in 2023. The official reserve assets as at December 31, 2024 were U.S.$155.7 billion, increased from U.S.$146.4 billion as at December 31, 2023.

In the first quarter of 2025, the current account recorded a deficit of U.S.$0.2 billion, a decrease from the U.S.$2.4 billion deficit in the first quarter of 2024. This improvement was primarily due to a higher non-oil and gas trade surplus, supported by the higher global commodity prices, coupled with a lower oil and gas trade deficit resulting from subdued domestic demand.

The capital and financial account recorded a deficit of U.S.$0.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease from the U.S.$2.4 billion deficit in the first quarter of 2024. This improvement was attributable to foreign capital inflows, mainly in the form of direct and portfolio investments, reflecting positive investor perception towards domestic economic outlook and the attractiveness of financial asset yields.

As a result of the foregoing, Indonesia’s balance of payments booked a deficit of U.S.$0.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025, which was narrower than the U.S.$6.0 billion deficit in the first quarter of 2024. As of March 31, 2025, official reserve assets stood at U.S.$157.1 billion, up from U.S.$140.4 billion as of March 31, 2024.

Financial System

Indonesia Financial Safety Net and Crisis Management

In April 2016, Law No. 9 of 2016 on the Prevention and Resolution of Financial System Crisis (as amended by Law No. 4/2023, “Law No. 9/2016”) was passed. Law No. 9/2016 revamped the coordination framework for crisis management and resolution among Indonesia Financial Safety Net (“KSSK”) participants and also refined the emphasis on strengthened supervisory capacity, improved banking liquidity and prevention measures. These coordinated policy responses allow an institutionalized early warning system and crisis management protocol which enable KSSK to identify potential disruptions, and determine effective policy responses and resolution steps.

As a participant of the KSSK, the Ministry of Finance also contributes to safeguard financial system stability. In the event of a disruption, such as sudden reversals in capital flows, the Crisis Management Protocol will be activated to determine the policy response required to maintain market confidence and stability. Policy responses include, amongst others, the Bond Stabilization Framework which provides the mechanism to execute buybacks with several SOEs for the purpose of maintaining stability of the sovereign bond market, placement of funds in instruments with a longer maturity period by issuing longer term securities, debt switching to lengthen debt maturities and reduce the risks associated with refinancing.

Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation and Liquidity Support

Since September 2005, the Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation (“IDIC”), has insured customers’ deposits and actively participated in maintaining the stability of the financial system. The IDIC membership is compulsory for every bank conducting business in Indonesia. The prevailing IDIC coverage is up to Rp2 billion for each depositor in any one bank. The IDIC will pay, in accordance with its procedures, deposit insurance claims when a member bank has its license revoked by the OJK. The maximum amount of deposit insured can be adjusted, among others, in the event of a crisis that can potentially decrease public trust in the banking system or affect the stability of the financial system.

The Government’s policy on addressing sudden reversals in capital flows involves, among others, the implementation of a Crisis Management Protocol, which involves cooperation between the Ministry of Finance, Bank Indonesia, OJK and IDIC. In the event of a financial crisis, policy steps could include executing buybacks for stabilization in the event of a disruption; taking steps to enhance cooperation among Government institutions, Bank Indonesia, SOEs, regulators and other market participants to maintain stability of the sovereign bond market; and encouraging the placement of funds in instruments with a longer maturity by issuing longer term securities and debt switching to lengthen debt maturities and reduce risks associated with refinancing.

Law No. 9/2016 provides a clear division of responsibilities between the Ministry of Finance, Bank Indonesia, OJK and IDIC in preventing and resolving crises in the financial system through the establishment of a Financial System Stability Committee with representatives from each of the Ministry of Finance, Bank Indonesia, OJK and IDIC. The Financial System Stability Committee aims to provide a coordinated policy response on the basis of regular monitoring of key areas of the financial system. In March 2020, certain provisions with respect to short term liquidity loans were revoked in order to enable the implementation of Covid-19 related financial policies.

Financial Sector Omnibus Law (Law No. 4/2023 )

Law No. 4/2023, which was enacted and became effective on January 12, 2023, represented a milestone for Indonesia’s financial sector reform and aims to develop an inclusive, deep and stable financial sector for accelerating the development of Indonesia’s national economy. Law No. 4/2023 is an omnibus law to amend 16 existing laws on financial sectors, such as banking, capital markets, insurance, guarantees, financing companies, financial system stability and export credits. Law No. 4/2023 also revoked the pension fund law and issued the new one.

Law No. 4/2023 focuses on, among others, strengthening the institutional setting of the authorities; strengthening governance of financial institutions; improving public’s trust in financial industry; promoting long- term fund accumulation in the financial sector for welfare and supporting sustainable development funding; strengthening of customers protection for financial products; and strengthening of financial sectors literacy, inclusion and innovation in the financial sector.

Among other provisions, Law No. 4/2023 grants supervisory authority over digital financial assets (including cryptocurrencies) and securities-related financial derivatives to OJK and over financial derivatives related to the money markets and FX to Bank Indonesia, rather than the commodities regulatory authority, Badan Pengawas Perdagangan Berjangka Komoditi. Law No. 4/2023 also mandates Bank Indonesia to be the sole authorized institution empowered to manage digital Rupiah.

The law also permits Bank Indonesia to purchase domestic government bonds (SBN) in the primary market during in the event of a crisis (as declared by the President). The acquisition of long-term government securities in the primary market shall be carried out pursuant to the decisions of the Financial System Stability Committee. The purchase scheme and mechanism of any such initiative under Law No 4/2023 is required to be stipulated in a joint decision by the Minister of Finance and the Governor of Bank Indonesia.

The Banking System

The Government’s policies for the banking sector emphasize the strengthening of the banking system.

The law governing Bank Indonesia (the “Central Bank Law”), Indonesia’s central bank, provides that Bank Indonesia will conduct monetary policy to achieve an inflation target as determined by the Government in consultation with Bank Indonesia. It also provides for the creation of the Bank Indonesia Supervisory Board (the “Supervisory Board”), to assist the DPR in conducting oversight of Bank Indonesia’s internal financial management. The Supervisory Board comprises five members chosen by the DPR and appointed by the President for three-year tenures. The January 2004 amendment also stipulates that Bank Indonesia is the lender of last resort to ensure the stability of the financial system. Bank Indonesia’s banking supervision function was transferred to the OJK on December 31, 2013. The latest amendment to the Central Bank Law was in 2023 through the enactment of Law No. 4/2023.

The authorities implement risk mitigation by strengthening micro and macro-prudential surveillance. Micro-prudential surveillance is performed on an individual bank or financial institution in order to ensure the fulfillment of prudential regulations through on-site and off-site supervision. Additionally, macro-prudential surveillance also aims to ensure that prudential regulations are adhered to at the industry level as an aggregate.

Under a framework of strengthening micro-prudential surveillance, a number of measures have been introduced by Bank Indonesia and the OJK to bolster and improve surveillance in order to better anticipate the symptoms of troubled banks on a risk basis, as well as enhance the quality of human resources through training, attachments and certification programs.

In addition, improvements to the tools and methodologies used in surveillance are ongoing in order to reinforce macro-prudential aspects, among others, stress testing, probability of default analysis, transition matrices and other early warning mechanisms. The creation of the financial system safety net also assists authorities to mitigate potential systemic risks that might arise.

OJK has issued banking regulations that are in line with the international standards, such as the Basel framework. In terms of the capital reforms, the Basel III capital framework has been transposed into domestic regulations and in force since December 2013, and was lastly amended in December 2022. These regulations cover (i) raising the quality of regulatory capital, (ii) setting a minimum Tier 1 and CET 1 ratio of 6% and 4.5%, respectively, as well as a minimum capital requirement based on risk profile between 8% to 14%, and (iii) building-up of adequate buffers above the minimum capital requirement based on risk profile (including a capital conservation buffer, countercyclical buffer and capital surcharge for D-SIBs). The December 2022 amendments also cover the capital requirements for bank’s exposure to central counterparties and margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives.

As part of its Basel III implementation policies, OJK issued regulations for the Basel III Liquidity framework, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”), Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”), and the risk weighted assets (“RWA”), calculation relating to derivative transactions. The LCR regulation was issued in December 2015 and requires banks to maintain short-term liquidity through high quality liquid assets that meet their liquidity needs for thirty days. The NSFR regulation was issued in July 2017 and uses NSFR as an indicator to evaluate a bank’s long-term liquidity risk by comparing the amount of stable funding available to the bank with the amount of stable funding required by the bank. It aims to reduce long-term liquidity risk by requiring banks to fund activities from stable and adequate sources of funds. Regulations relating to the RWA calculation for derivative transactions were issued in September 2017, providing guidelines for calculating the risk exposure to derivative transactions due to counterparty credit risk.

Under the Prevention and Resolution of Financial System Crisis law, OJK has issued a regulation concerning a systemic bank recovery plan in April 2017. This regulation was later consolidated under OJK Regulation No. 5 of Year 2024 concerning the Determination of Status of Supervision and Problem Handling and Commercial Banks. This regulation establishes the requirements for systemic banks to prepare and submit recovery plans. Systemic banks are also required to have guidelines in relation to the recovery plan in place, which are prepared by taking into account the governance principles supporting the implementation of the recovery plan. Moreover, systemic banks are also obliged to evaluate and perform stress testing in order to assess the adequacy of their recovery plans at least once a year.

As of December 31, 2022, total banking assets were Rp11,315.8 trillion, consisting of commercial bank assets of Rp11,113.3 trillion and rural bank assets (including assets of Sharia rural banks) of Rp202.5 trillion.

As of December 31, 2023, total banking assets were Rp11,984.0 trillion, consisting of commercial bank assets of Rp11,765.8 trillion and rural bank assets (including assets of Sharia rural banks) of Rp218.2 trillion.

As of December 31, 2024, total banking assets were Rp12,690.7 trillion, consisting of commercial bank assets of Rp12,461.0 trillion and rural bank assets (including assets of Sharia rural banks) of Rp229.7 trillion.

As of March 31, 2025, total banking assets were Rp12,955.2 trillion, consisting of commercial bank assets of Rp12,726.9 trillion and rural bank assets (including assets of Sharia rural banks) of Rp228.3 trillion.

Islamic Financial System

The Government believes that the Islamic finance banking industry has an opportunity to grow rapidly in Indonesia, which has the largest Muslim population in the world. The industry provides the Muslim community with alternative financial products and services that conform to Sharia principles. These Sharia principles as applied to the Islamic finance banking industry includes Sharia concepts related to mudarabah (profit and loss sharing), wadiah (safekeeping), musharaka (joint venture), murabahah (cost plus), and ijara (leasing). Sharia prohibits riba, or usury, defined as interest paid on all loans of money. Furthermore, investments in some businesses that provide goods or services considered contrary to Islamic principles (such as pork or alcohol) are also considered haraam (sinful and prohibited) under Sharia principles. To assist with the development and growth of Islamic financial services in Indonesia, these alternative financial products are considered an integral part of the banking industry and contribute to enhancing the stability of the Indonesian financial system by supporting national economic development in Indonesia.

Law No. 21 of 2008 on Sharia Banking (as lastly amended by Law No. 4/2023, the “Sharia Banking Law”) was enacted to facilitate the expansion of the Indonesian Islamic banking industry. The Sharia Banking Law applies Sharia principles to banking for Sharia banks and Sharia divisions of conventional banks, prohibiting the payment and receipt of interest and providing that returns on funds that are distributed or lent out must be based on the actual profits generated. The Sharia Banking Law also prohibits Islamic banking business and transactions that would support practices or products forbidden or discouraged by Sharia principles. The Government believes that this legislation will better position Indonesia as a venue for Islamic banking and finance.

One of the main challenges for Indonesia’s Sharia capital markets is the small number of companies that issue Sharia-compliant products such as Islamic bonds (“Sukuk”).

The Indonesian Islamic financial industry has been developing under the regulatory authority of OJK (since December 31, 2013) and previously Bank Indonesia, which formulates and publishes a strategic plan for the development of the industry. OJK has established a new strategic plan for the development of Indonesia’s Islamic banking industry for 2020-2025. This new strategic plan is expected to provide guidelines that include detailed initiatives as well as specific objectives for the Sharia banking industry to achieve. This strategic plan for the development of the national Sharia banking industry is recognized as the “Roadmap of Indonesian Islamic Banking 2020-2025” with a view to “establish a Sharia banking industry that contributes to facilitating the development of the halal industry and a competitive and efficient Sharia banking industry by increase of business scale and application of technology.” The roadmap includes, among others, the following measures: (i) establishment of Shariah banker code of conduct and basic competence, (ii) strengthening the implementation of compliance and internal audit functions on compliance with Sharia principles, (iii) issuance of regulations to develop Sharia banking products to be offered to the customers and to aid national priority programs, (iv) strengthening the capital of Sharia banking entities and issuing regulations on banking synergy and settlement of Shariah People’s Financing Bank (Bank Pembiayaan Rakyat Syariah), and (v) encouraging digitalization of Sharia banking.

OJK and Bank Indonesia have issued various regulations in order to support the growth and development of the Sharia banking industry taking into account precautionary principles and Sharia principles.

The Sharia Non-Bank Financial Industry (Industri keuangan Non Bank Syariah or IKNB Sharia) is also supervised by OJK and consists of the Sharia Insurance Company, the Sharia Pension Fund, the Sharia Financial Institution and other Sharia Financial Service Institutions. OJK issued OJK Regulation No. 35 of 2024 to govern the Sharia pension funds which came into force in March 2025. Under the regulation, management of Sharia pension funds may be conducted by way of: (i) establishment of Sharia pension fund, (ii) conversion of pension fund into Sharia pension fund, (iii) formation of Sharia unit in Employee Pension Fund, or (iv) sale of Sharia investment package in financial institution pension fund.

As of December 31, 2022, of the 87 underwriters licensed by OJK, only 33 were involved in issuances of Sukuk, and of the 96 investment managers licensed by OJK, there are 61 investment managers having Sharia investment management unit and one Sharia investment manager.

As of December 31, 2023, of the 88 underwriters licensed by OJK, only 34 were involved in issuances of Sukuk, and of the 94 investment managers licensed by OJK, there are 60 investment managers having Sharia investment management unit and one Sharia investment manager.

As of December 31, 2024, out of the 89 underwriters licensed by OJK, 36 were involved in issuances of Sukuk; and out of the 91 investment managers licensed by OJK, there were 59 investment managers with Sharia investment management units.

As of March 31, 2025, out of the 89 underwriters licensed by OJK, 36 were involved in issuances of Sukuk; and out of the 90 investment managers licensed by OJK, there were 59 investment managers with Sharia investment management units.

As of December 31, 2022, assets of Sharia banks were Rp782.1 trillion, or 7.0% of Indonesia’s total banking assets.

As of December 31, 2023, assets of Sharia banks were Rp869.0 trillion, or 6.8% of Indonesia’s total banking assets.

As of December 31, 2024, assets of Sharia banks were Rp955.3 trillion, or 7.5% of Indonesia’s total banking assets.

As of March 31, 2025, assets of Sharia banks were Rp960.8 trillion, or 7.5% of Indonesia’s total banking assets.

Anti-Money Laundering Regime

Various financial regulatory agencies in the Republic were formed to combat money laundering activities within Indonesia. In 2002, the Government enacted an anti-money laundering law (“2002 AML Law”), and established a financial intelligence unit, the Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Pusat Pelaporan Analisis Transaksi Keuangan (“PPATK”)). The PPATK’s duties were later expanded to include matters relating to countering terrorism financing, and consequently, the PPATK was appointed to be the focal point of countering money- laundering and financing of terrorism in Indonesia.

Some of the significant progress made in implementing the Government’s anti-money laundering laws and countering financing of terrorism, national strategies in the last few years includes: promulgating a new Anti-Money Laundering Law, namely, Law No. 8 of 2010 on the Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering Crimes (the “2010 AML Law”), and the ratification of the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. The 2010 AML Law came into force on October 22, 2010 replacing the 2002 AML Law, as amended, to be in line with current international standards and best practices.

As part of the implementation of the Government’s policy to prevent and eradicate the crime of money laundering, the PPATK has issued and continues to issue various regulations as further implementation of the 2010 AML Law.

On March 13, 2013, the DPR adopted Law No. 9 of 2013 on the Prevention and Eradication of the Financing of Terrorism (“Law No. 9”). Law No. 9 comprehensively regulates: (i) the criminalization of terrorist financing offenses and other offenses related to terrorism financing offenses; (ii) the application of the principle of recognizing users of financial services; reporting and compliance monitoring; (iii) surveillance activities through a remittance transfer system or through other systems by financial service providers; (iv) control disposition of cash and/or other payment instruments into or outside the Indonesian customs area; (v) blocking mechanisms relating to the movement of cash and/or other payment instruments; (vi) the inclusion in the list of suspected terrorists and terrorist organizations; and (vii) arrangements regarding the setting of the investigation, prosecution, and examination at trial.

Terrorism financing within the scope of Law No. 9 includes acts committed, directly or indirectly, in order to provide, gather, give, or lend funds to those who are known to intend to commit an act of terrorism. In addition to individuals, Law No. 9 regulates the criminalization of terrorist financing to terrorist organizations. Terrorist organizations within Law No. 9 can include a collection of people who have a common goal and that, based on a court decision, have committed an act of terrorism. Parties that are named in lists of terrorist organizations also fall within the scope of Law No. 9.

Since 2017, OJK has required any financial service provider to identify, assess and understand the risk of money laundering and/or terrorism financing crimes related to customers, countries, geographic areas, products, services, transaction or delivery channels. To perform these types of activities, the financial service provider must establish policies, supervision and maintenance procedures and mitigation of money laundering and terrorism financing risks and establish a special task force and/or appoint an officer to act as a person-in-charge for the implementation of anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing programs. The financial service provider is required to submit suspicious financial transaction reports, cash transaction reports and other reports to the PPATK. In September 2019, OJK began to require certain additional measures to prevent the funding and proliferation of weapons of mass destructions, namely the requirements for OJK to conduct data maintenance, identity and background checking of transaction parties and immediate blocking of suspected transactions.

Bank Indonesia

Bank Indonesia’s statutory mandate states that “the goal of Bank Indonesia as the central bank of the Republic of Indonesia is to achieve Rupiah stability, maintain payment system stability and contribute in maintaining financial system stability to support sustainable economic growth.” Rupiah stability is measured by the stability of prices of goods and services as well as the Rupiah exchange rate. The stability of prices of goods and services is reflected by a low and stable inflation. Stability of exchange rate is reflected by a stable Rupiah exchange rate against other currencies. A stable exchange rate is inherent in supporting a low and stable inflation, and both are crucial in achieving sustainable economic growth. Market conditions determine the Rupiah exchange rate, consistent with the floating exchange rate system adopted by Bank Indonesia in August 1997. See “Foreign Exchange and Reserves — Exchange Rates.” Bank Indonesia may, however, continue to use its policy instruments to minimize exchange rate fluctuations.

Bank Indonesia, as a separate legal entity from the Government, has its own assets and its own liabilities. The foreign exchange reserves held by Bank Indonesia are recorded on the assets side of the Bank Indonesia balance sheet, while certain items of foreign debt (such as loans from the IMF) are liabilities of Bank Indonesia.

The following table sets forth the balance sheet of Bank Indonesia and was prepared in accordance with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual published by the IMF, as of the dates indicated.

Indonesian banks are divided into two categories: commercial banks and rural banks. Both commercial and rural banks may operate under either conventional banking principles or under Sharia principles.

The OJK is responsible for the regulation and supervision of the insurance industry. Development of this sub-sector has required the implementation of more robust regulatory requirements and, in particular, improved capital requirements, including requirements to continuously maintain a specified ratio of risk-weighted assets to risk-weighted liabilities.

Pension funds are divided into two categories: employer pension funds and financial institution pension funds. Employer pension funds may be run either as defined benefit plans or as defined contribution plans, while financial institution pension funds may only be run as defined contribution plans.

Indonesia’s other non-bank financial institutions include finance companies, guarantee companies, venture capital companies, Indonesia export credit agencies, infrastructure financing companies and secondary mortgage facilities companies.

Non-Performing Loans

Since the beginning of 2005, Indonesian banks have been required to calculate their non-performing loans (“NPLs”), using international best practices-based standards that require banks to classify as “non-performing” all loans to any borrower if any of that borrower’s loans are non- performing. Banks nationwide are required to apply the same uniform loan classification system to all loans meeting one of three criteria: (i) loans greater than Rp10 billion that are made to one borrower or one similar project; (ii) loans between Rp1 billion and Rp10 billion that are made to one of the 50 largest debtors of the lending bank; and (iii) loans based on joint financing to one borrower or one project.

Capital Markets and Capital Markets Regulation

The Indonesian capital markets are regulated by the OJK, which superseded the Capital Markets and Financial Institutions Supervisory Agency (Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal dan Lembaga Keuangan (“Bapepam-LK”)) and assumed its duties and functions when Bapepam-LK and the Ministry of Finance’s Directorate General of Financial Institution, were merged into a single unit on December 31, 2012.

The regulatory framework for the Indonesian capital markets is provided by the Capital Markets Law No. 8 of 1995 on Capital Markets (as amended by Law No. 4/2023, the “Capital Markets Law”). The Capital Markets Law granted the original regulatory authority (and its successors, including OJK) authority in the fields of regulation, development, supervision and law enforcement. The law also provides the authority and responsibilities of self-regulatory organizations, capital market institutions, professionals and firms conducting business in the capital markets. According to the Capital Markets Law, OJK is responsible for the guidance, regulation and day-to-day supervision necessary to implement orderly, fair and efficient capital markets and to protect the interests of investors and the public.

Over the past few years, OJK has introduced rules to strengthen its supervisory and enforcement capacity over Indonesia’s capital markets and to promote sound and transparent capital markets. It has exercised its authority over publicly listed companies by issuing new corporate governance regulations to make corporate management and audit committees more directly responsible for financial reports. OJK has also issued revised regulations on the content of listed companies’ annual reports, general meeting of shareholders, board of directors and board of commissioners, remuneration and nomination committees, and corporate secretary.

The following table sets forth key indicators regarding the IDX and any securities traded on the IDX as of and for the four months ended April 30, 2025.

As the largest Muslim country in the world, Indonesia has been engaged in an initiative to establish a legal framework for the development of an investor market in Indonesia for Sharia-compliant securities, which are securities that comply with the tenets of Islamic legal principles. The OJK and Bapepam-LK issued various regulations on the form and issuance of Sharia-compliant commercial paper and mutual funds to enhance the growth of the Sharia-compliant securities industry and to provide alternative mutual fund products to investors within Indonesia as well as to attract Muslim investors outside Indonesia.

The IDX, a self-regulatory body, has two indices based on Sharia stock, the Jakarta Islamic Index (“JII”), and the Indonesia Sharia Stock Index (“ISSI”).

The JII is a stock market index established on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. The JII was launched in 2000 and consists of the 30 largest Sharia-compliant listings by market capitalization and average liquidity in the regular market. As of December 31, 2024 and April 30, 2025, the market capitalization of the JII was Rp3,340.6 trillion and Rp3,794.7 trillion, respectively.

The IDX launched the Indonesia Sharia Stock Index, or ISSI on May 12, 2011. As of December 31, 2024, the ISSI comprised of 616 Sharia stocks listed on the IDX and its market capitalization was Rp6,825.3 trillion. As of April 30, 2025, the ISSI comprised of 626 Sharia stocks listed on the IDX and its market capitalization was Rp6,863.1 trillion.

Monetary Policy

In order to ensure financial and macroeconomic stability, Bank Indonesia also deploys a variety of policy instruments (policy mix approach) which consist of (i) policy rate to anchor inflation expectation complemented by (ii) exchange rate flexibility to lessen pressure on current account, (iii) capital flow management to dampen short-term excessive volatility of exchange rate, (iv) appropriate macroprudential measures, and (v) ensure good communication to the public. Bank Indonesia also pursues financial market deepening to support the stability of the Rupiah exchange rate and enhance the effectiveness of transmission of monetary policy.

During 2020, Bank Indonesia strengthened its policy mix oriented towards safeguarding economic stability and stimulating economic recovery from the distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The policy response was instituted through an accommodative monetary policy mix, including reductions in the Bank Indonesia 7-Day Reverse Repo Rate (“BI Rate”), liquidity injections, strengthening the monetary operations strategy and guiding the exchange rate towards the currency’s fundamental value. Accommodative macroprudential policy was maintained along with efforts to strengthen payment system policy in order to accelerate the digital economy and finance, buttressed by other supporting policies. Bank Indonesia also continued to strengthen synergy with the Government and other relevant authorities in order to follow up on all responsibilities in accordance with Law No. 2 of 2020 as part of the national policy response under the extraordinary conditions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Bank Indonesia lowered the BI Rate five times in 2020. BI Rate reductions in 2020 totaled 125 basis points, bringing the BI Rate to 3.75% by the end of 2020. Reductions of 25 basis points (“bps”) were announced at each Board of Governors Meeting in February, March, June, July and November 2020. The measured decision to reduce gradually the BI Rate was based on low inflation and the need to maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of domestic financial assets for investment for the sake of external stability.

To stimulate national economic recovery and maintain financial system stability, Bank Indonesia also introduced monetary stimuli in the form of quantitative easing. As of the end of 2020, Bank Indonesia had injected Rupiah liquidity totaling approximately Rp726.57 trillion, equivalent to 4.7% of GDP, primarily in the form of lower reserve requirements totaling around Rp155 trillion and monetary expansion totaling approximately Rp555.77 trillion. Bank Indonesia lowered reserve requirements by 300 bps, including the 50 bps incentive, in 2020. In addition, Bank Indonesia lowered the foreign currency reserve requirements by 400 bps, effective March 16, 2020 in order to boost foreign exchange liquidity in the banking industry and alleviate pressures in the foreign exchange market. Bank Indonesia also waived the additional macroprudential intermediation ratio (“MIR”) Giro, the balance of Rupiah demand deposits held at Bank Indonesia to meet MIR. This policy provided approximately Rp15.8 trillion of additional liquidity to the banking industry. In the latter half of the year, Bank Indonesia provided Giro services to banks meeting the daily and average Rupiah reserve requirements of 1.5% per year, with a portion calculated to obtain a Giro service of 3% of deposit, effective August 1, 2020.

Bank Indonesia also maintained a Rupiah exchange rate stabilization policy in line with the currency’s fundamental value and market mechanisms amid persistent global financial market uncertainty. Bank Indonesia stabilized and strengthened the Rupiah by increasing the intensity of triple-intervention policy in the spot market, Domestic Non-Deliverable Forwards (“DNDF”), transactions and purchases of Government securities in the secondary market. In addition, in March 2020, Bank Indonesia lowered the foreign currency reserve requirement by 400 bps to boost foreign exchange liquidity in the banking sector and simultaneously alleviate pressure on the foreign exchange market, as well as expanding the types of underlying transactions for foreign investors to provide an alternative hedging instrument against Rupiah holdings. Furthermore, exchange rate stabilization policy is supported by efforts to reinforce external resilience. To that end, Bank Indonesia secured a bilateral repo line agreement with the US Federal Reserve and extended bilateral swap and repo line agreements with the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Furthermore, Bank Indonesia expanded money market and foreign exchange market instruments and transactions in order to provide more hedging instruments against currency risk through DNDF transactions, foreign exchange swaps and term repo agreements with the banking industry, while strengthening monetary operations and Islamic financial market deepening through the Sharia Compliant Liquidity Facility, Sharia-Compliant Liquidity Management and Sharia-Compliant Interbank Fund Management Certificates. In addition, Bank Indonesia also strengthened foreign currency term deposit instruments in order to enhance foreign currency liquidity management in the domestic markets, while encouraging banks to utilize lower foreign currency reserve requirements for domestic purposes. Furthermore, to strengthen money market and foreign exchange market deepening, Bank Indonesia was also encouraging infrastructure development in terms of electronic trading platforms and a central counterparty. Striving to enhance transmission of its accommodative monetary policy stance, Bank Indonesia continued to strengthen its monetary operations strategy, while developing money market instruments to support corporate and small and medium enterprise (“SME”) financing in line with the national economic recovery program.

Bank Indonesia implemented an accommodative macro-prudential policy in line with the existing policy mix and national policy mix, including various efforts to mitigate risk in the financial sector caused by the outbreak of Covid-19. Therefore, Bank Indonesia relaxed the MIR by extending the incentive period of 50 bps lower Rupiah reserve requirements for banks allocating SME loans, loans for export-import activity as well as non-SME loans to priority sectors as stipulated in the national economic recovery program from previously December 31, 2020 to June 30, 2021, while also injecting liquidity into the banking industry to support loan restructuring for SMEs as well as ultra-micro enterprises with loans from financial institutions and strengthening macro-prudential policies to encourage inclusive financing, particularly for SMEs. Furthermore, Bank Indonesia maintained a Countercyclical Buffer ratio of 0%, MIR in the range of 84-94% with a disincentive parameter of 0%, a Macroprudential Liquidity Buffer ratio of 6% with repo flexibility of 6%, and a Loan to Value / Financing to ratio Value for property credit / financing is in accordance with current regulations. Bank Indonesia also lowered the minimum down payment on automotive loans/financing from 5-10% to 0% for the purchase of green vehicles, while maintaining prudential principles.

Bank Indonesia maintained cash and non-cash payment system convenience and availability in order to facilitate economic and financial transactions. This was achieved through, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the circulation of sanitized currency notes and the promotion of cashless transactions through e-money, internet banking and the launch of an Indonesian standard for quick response codes, as well as accelerating the implementation of the digital economy and finance as part of the economic recovery efforts. Bank Indonesia also implemented measures among the banking industry, financial technology companies, the Government and other relevant authorities to promote digitalization and support the economic recovery.

Bank Indonesia has also accelerated the implementation of the Indonesia payment systems blueprint for 2025 to support digital economy and finance activities during the Covid-19 pandemic, stimulate a momentum for national economic recovery as well as expedite economic and financial inclusion. Bank Indonesia also continued to strengthen synergies with the Government and other relevant authorities to support cashless social aid program disbursements through expediting the electronification of the social aid program disbursements, including the Family Hope Program, Noncash Food Assistance Program, Pre-Employment Card and Indonesia Smart Card to help alleviate the impact of Covid-19.

In 2021, Bank Indonesia oriented all monetary, macroprudential and payment system policy instruments towards supporting the national economic recovery in close coordination with the Government and Financial System Stability Committee as follows:

 	(i)
In the monetary sector, a historically low policy rate was maintained along with the maintenance of Rupiah exchange rate stability and liquidity injections through quantitative easing. The low policy rate would be maintained until there are indications of rising inflation. Since 2020, Bank Indonesia lowered the BI Rate six times to 3.50%, the lowest in history. The Rupiah exchange rate stabilization policy was implemented through triple intervention targeting the spot market, DNDF and purchases of government securities in the secondary market, amid persistent global financial market uncertainty. Likewise, Bank Indonesia continued to inject liquidity via quantitative easing to strengthen the banking industry’s ability to extend credit/financing to the corporate sector. In 2020 and 2021, the quantitative easing policy resulted in liquidity injections of Rp874.4 trillion into the banking industry to support the national economic recovery program;

 	(ii)
Accommodative macroprudential policies continued to revive bank financing disbursed to the corporate sector, in synergy with Financial elevated uncertainty System Stability Committee policy. This included loosening the down payment requirements on automotive loans; the Loan/Financing-to-Value (LTV/FTV) Ratio on Property Loans and the (Sharia) MIR; encouraging the banks to lower prime lending rates; as well as other accommodative macroprudential policies. Bank Indonesia also refined and modernized the MSME Credit Ratio policy into the Macroprudential Inclusive Financing Ratio (Rasio Pembiayaan Inklusif Makroprudensial (“RPIM”));

 	(iii)
Bank Indonesia continued to accelerate payment system digitalization for integration of the national digital economy and finance. This included expansion of Quick Response Code Indonesian Standard (“QRIS”) acceptance to 12 million merchants by the end of 2021, including cross-border QRIS, implementation of the National Open API Payment Standard; as well as electronification of social aid program (bansos) disbursements, transportation modes and government financial operations. Various agendas in the Indonesia Payment System Blueprint (Blueprint Sistem Pembayaran Indonesia (“BSPI”)) 2025 had also been accelerated, including development of Bank Indonesia-Fast Payment (“BI-FAST”) as a real-time retail payment system available 24/7, along with interlinkages between digital banking and FinTech, as well as payment system regulatory reform;

 	(iv)
In addition to the three main policy initiatives above, Bank Indonesia also directed four supporting policies (MSMEs, Islamic economy and finance, financial market deepening, and international policy) towards national economic recovery. Bank Indonesia enhanced the policy synergy with the Government, banks, and other institutions to develop MSMEs as well as the Islamic economy and finance as a new source of national economic growth in Indonesia. Financial market deepening also accelerated, particularly the Rupiah and foreign exchange money markets, to strengthen monetary policy transmission, support financial system stability, and finance development, including infrastructure. International policy was directed towards not only strengthening Bank Indonesia’s policy diplomacy, but also to support the Government in facilitating and promoting trade and investment in various countries; and

 	(v)
Bank Indonesia also adjusted its operational activities and public services to support Government restrictions on public mobility during the Covid-19 pandemic. This included cash services, payment systems, monetary operations and central banking services to the Government. In addition, Bank Indonesia temporarily increased the maximum limit on cash withdrawals through ATM machines using chip technology until 30 September 2021.

During 2022, Bank Indonesia raised the BI Rate by 200 bps to 5.50% since August 2022. The decision to increase the interest rate is a front-loaded, pre-emptive, and forward-looking measure to cause the inflation expectations and inflation to decline, so that the core inflation is maintained within the range of 3.0±1%. This is in line with the increase in inflation expectations after the increase in subsidized fuel prices which had reached 6.5% and needed to be controlled to avoid pressure on core inflation. With the increase in the BI Rate, inflation expectations gradually decreased to 5.5% and therefore supported lower core inflation realization of 3.36% (year-on-year) at the end of 2022 compared to the initial forecast of 4.16% (year-on-year). In line with this, Bank Indonesia also strengthened monetary operations by increasing the structure of interest rates on the money market in accordance with the increase in the BI Rate.

The direction of the BI policy mix in 2022 continues to be synergized as part of the national policy direction to accelerate economic recovery while maintaining stability. In this regard, in line with the risk of increasing uncertainty in the global financial markets due to the tightening monetary policies in advanced economies, especially the United States, amid the early stages of Indonesia’s economic recovery, Bank Indonesia adopted a policy mix consisting of “one policy to maintain stability and four policies to support economic growth” as it has alluded to before. Monetary policy is directed at maintaining stability (pro-stability), while the other four instruments, namely macroprudential policies, digitalization of the payment system, deepening of the money market, as well as inclusive and green economy-finance are aimed to accelerate national economic recovery (pro-growth).

The key points of Bank Indonesia’s policy mix implemented in 2022 are as follows:

 	1.
Monetary policy was aimed at ensuring macroeconomic stability, through increase of policy rate (BI Rate), Rupiah exchange rate stabilization, and liquidity normalization. In this context, in line with the low core inflation pressures, especially in the first semester of 2022, the monetary policy response was taken by normalizing liquidity through a gradual increase in the reserves requirement ratio to 9% for conventional commercial banks and 7.5% for Sharia commercial banks and Sharia business units. Bank Indonesia adopted this policy to proactively address the impact of global financial market uncertainty on macroeconomic stability. Meanwhile, the BI Rate was raised by 200 bps since August 2022 to 5.50% at the end of 2022 in response to the increasing inflation expectations and to make sure that core inflation remained within 3±1% range. This policy was supported by Rupiah exchange rate stabilization policy as part of the measures to control inflation, primarily imported inflation, through foreign exchange intervention, including spot and DNDF transactions, as well as buying/selling SBN in the secondary market (twist operation).

 	2.
Macroprudential policies continued to be accommodative in synergy with the integrated policy package of the Financial System Stability Committee to support the national economic recovery. Bank Indonesia continued to maintain accommodative macroprudential policies by holding the Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CcyB) ratio at 0%, the MIR at the range of 84-94%, and the Macroprudential Liquidity Buffer (“MPLB”) ratio at 6% with repo flexibility of 6%, and the Sharia MPLB ratio at 4.5% with repo flexibility of 4.5%. Bank Indonesia also continued to relax the Loan to Value/Financing to Value (LTV/FTV) ratio for property loans/financing to a maximum of 100% and relaxed the down payment requirements for automotive loans to 0% for all types of new vehicles. Bank Indonesia also strengthened the prime lending rate transparency policy to support the effectiveness of the transmission of the policy rate and macroprudential policy. In addition, Bank Indonesia increased incentives for banks to disburse loans to priority sectors and MSME and/or meet the Macroprudential Inclusive Financing Ratio (RPIM) target in the form of easing Rupiah reserve requirements and expanding the coverage of priority sectors.

Bank Indonesia continued to strengthen payment system policies to support economic recovery and accelerate inclusive digitalization. These policies included: (i) expanding the use of QRIS; (ii) intensification of the electronification program through digitizing government social assistance programs, electronification of regional government services, and also the integration of modes of transportation; (iii) strengthening the implementation of the National Open API Payment Standard by encouraging the acceleration of its adoption for banks and non-bank institutions; (iv) accelerating the implementation of BI-FAST by increasing membership, expanding services, and accepting the use of BI-FAST; and (v) payment system pricing policies to support national economic recovery.

These three major policies were supported by the synergy among the efforts of Bank Indonesia and the Government, banks, and other institutions to continue support for MSMEs as well as the Sharia economy and finance. Bank Indonesia also pursued deepening of foreign exchange market to support Rupiah stability and to expand hedging instruments and continued to accelerate the promotion of trade and investment between countries, including through the expansion of local currency transactions. In addition, Bank Indonesia continued to strengthen its international policy and practice by expanding international cooperation with other central banks and monetary authorities, promoting trade and investment in priority sectors in synergy with other relevant institutions.

In 2023, Bank Indonesia’s policy mix continued to be directed towards strengthening resilience, recovery, and revival of the Indonesia economy in a close synergy with national economic policy. Meanwhile, the policy mix intended to counteract the spillover effects of global turmoil, including the risks of economic recession and high inflation, policy rate hikes by the United States Federal Reserves and other central banks, depreciatory pressures on the Rupiah exchange rate due to a very strong U.S. dollar, as well as high global financial market uncertainty. To that end, the objective of monetary policy is to manage inflation back towards the target corridor set by the Government, namely 3.0%±1% in 2023 and 2.5%±1% in 2024, to maintain Rupiah stability against the impact of global turmoil to control imported inflation, as well as to support macroeconomic and financial system stability. Meanwhile, to support national economic growth, accommodative macroprudential policies continue to be oriented towards encouraging lending/financing to the businesses, particularly priority sectors. Similarly, Bank Indonesia continued accelerating payment system digitalization to expand digital economic and financial inclusion, specifically in the real sector and MSMEs as drivers of private consumption. The mix of three main Bank Indonesia policies, namely monetary policy, macroprudential policy and payment system policy, were also supported by strengthening money market and foreign exchange market deepening policy, MSMEs empowerment and Sharia economy and finance development programs as well as international policy.

In December 2023, Bank Indonesia maintained the BI Rate at 6.00%, the deposit facility rate at 5.25% and the lending facility rate at 6.75%.

The decision remains consistent with the pro-stability focus of monetary policy, namely, to strengthen Rupiah stabilization policy, and as a pre-emptive and forward-looking measure to maintain inflation within the 2.5%±1% target corridor in 2024. Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia will maintain pro-growth macroprudential and payment system policies to foster sustainable economic growth. Bank Indonesia will also hold an accommodative macroprudential policy stance to revive bank lending/financing to businesses and households. Payment system digitalization will be accelerated to increase transaction volume and expand digital economic and financial inclusion, which includes the electronification of (central and regional) government transactions. Bank Indonesia has, therefore, strengthened its mix of monetary, macroprudential and payment system policies to maintain stability and nurture sustainable economic growth through the following measures:

 	1.
Rupiah stabilization through foreign exchange market intervention with a focus on spot and domestic non-deliverable forward transactions, as well as government securities in the secondary market.

 	2.
Strengthening the pro-market monetary operations strategy for effective monetary policy, which includes optimizing SRBI, Bank Indonesia Forex Securities and Bank Indonesia Forex Sukuk.

 	3.
Deepening prime lending rate transparency policy with a focus on interest rates by economic sector.

 	4.
Accelerating payment system digitalization towards greater transaction efficiency and expanding the digital economy and finance ecosystem as follows: (a) Expanding QRIS implementation by: (i) setting a target of 55 million QRIS users in 2024, (ii) setting a target of 2.5 billion QRIS transactions in 2024, and (iii) strengthening the cross-border QRIS implementation strategy to accelerate uptake, (b) Strengthening implementation of Indonesian Credit Card (Kartu Kredit Indonesia) (i.e., credit cards that use an Indonesian payment network, rather than foreign payment networks such as Visa or Mastercard) for the government segment by developing online payment features, while expanding more intensive socialization, coordination and monitoring activities.

 	5.
Expanding international cooperation with other central banks and authorities in partner countries, particularly through cross-border QRIS linkages and local currency transactions, as well as facilitating investment, trade and tourism promotion in priority sectors in conjunction with relevant institutions.

Policy coordination between Bank Indonesia and the government of the Republic is also constantly improved to maintain macroeconomic stability and bolster economic growth. Bank Indonesia strengthens policy coordination with the central and regional government and strategic partners, including the National Movement for Food Inflation Control in various regions within the Central and Regional Inflation Control Teams, as well as Region Digitalization Acceleration and Expansion (P2DD) Teams to Accelerate and Expand the Electronification of Central and Regional Government Transactions. Furthermore, policy synergy between Bank Indonesia and the KSSK is also strengthened to maintain financial system stability and revive lending/financing to businesses, particularly those in priority sectors.

In 2024, Bank Indonesia’s policy mix is directed at strengthening economic stability and supporting sustainable growth, in close synergy with the national economic policy mix. Monetary policy in 2024 is focused primarily on maintaining stability (pro-stability), while macroprudential and payment system policies remain directed at supporting economic growth (pro-growth). This policy direction aims to balance between maintaining stability amid high global uncertainties and supporting sustainable economic growth. The 2024 monetary policy targets are focused on controlling inflation within the 2.5±1% target range and stabilizing the Rupiah exchange rate against global shocks, consistent with inflation control and support for macroeconomic and financial system stability. Meanwhile, to support economic growth, accommodative macroprudential policies continue to be directed at encouraging bank credit/financing to priority sectors, while maintaining financial system stability. Likewise, the digitalization of payment systems continues to be accelerated to support inclusive economic growth through the expansion of digital economy and finance. The mix of monetary, macroprudential and payment system policies is supported by strengthening policies on money and foreign exchange market deepening, developing MSMEs, Islamic economy and finance, and international policies. Monetary policies aimed at controlling inflation and stabilizing the Rupiah exchange rate are implemented through consistent and prudent interest rate policies, supported by foreign exchange market intervention, pro-market monetary operation strategies and adequate foreign exchange reserves.

Consistent with this policy direction, Bank Indonesia in April 2024 raised the BI-Rate by 25 bps to 6.25% amid increasing global uncertainty and rising inflation pressures. Subsequently, as the trajectory of the federal funds rate (“FFR”) becomes more evident, followed by an FFR cut that eased global turmoil, Bank Indonesia lowered the BI-Rate by 25 bps to 6.0% on September 17, 2024, one day before the Federal Reserve’s FFR reduction in September 2024. This BI-Rate cut is consistent with pre-emptive and forward-looking measures to keep inflation in 2024 and 2025 within the 2.5±1% target. Bank Indonesia also anticipates still room for further BI-Rate cuts given low inflation projection and the need to support sustainable economic growth. Further decisions regarding the BI-Rate will be made from time to time in the Board of Governors Meetings based on global and domestic economic dynamics (data dependent).

Based on Bank Indonesia’s policy mix stance, the following policy instruments were implemented in 2024.

1.
Monetary policy. Inflation control and Rupiah stability were achieved through a consistent and well-calibrated policy rate, underpinned by foreign exchange market intervention, a pro-market monetary operations strategy, and adequate reserve assets. To that end, Bank Indonesia has been directing BI-Rate policy toward achieving the inflation targets in 2024 and 2025. Meanwhile, Rupiah stabilization efforts aim to mitigate short-term volatility and control the impact of imported inflation through triple intervention in the spot, domestic non-deliverable forward and SBN markets as needed. The effectiveness of monetary policy transmission was strengthened by a pro-market monetary operations strategy through optimization of Bank Indonesia Rupiah Securities (Sekuritas Rupiah Bank Indonesia, “SRBI”), Bank Indonesia Foreign Exchange Securities and Bank Indonesia Foreign Exchange Sukuk to attract portfolio inflows and maintain Rupiah stability, while deepening the money market and foreign exchange markets. Inflation control, particularly for food, was supported by close coordination with the Government through the Central and Regional Government Inflation Control Teams and the National Movement for Food Inflation Control nationwide.

2.
Macroprudential policy. Bank Indonesia increased liquidity incentives and loosened macroprudential instruments to stimulate bank lending/financing and maintain financial system stability. Additional liquidity incentives were provided to banks through implementation of the macroprudential liquidity incentive policy to promote bank lending/financing to priority sectors, including downstream sectors (mineral and coal mining, agriculture, plantation crops and fishing), housing (including public housing), tourism, the creative economy, and green economy and finance, and to enhance financial inclusion of MSMEs, people’s business credit program, and ultra-micro enterprises. The flexibility of liquidity management in the banking industry was also enhanced by loosening the macroprudential liquidity buffer. Likewise, all other macroprudential policy instruments remained loose, including the countercyclical capital buffer, macroprudential intermediation ratio, loan/financing-to-value ratio for property loans/financing, down payment requirements on automotive loans/ financing, and bank foreign funding ratio. Macroprudential and money market surveillance of the banking system was strengthened to help maintain financial system stability in close coordination with the Financial System Stability Committee.

3.
Payment system policy. Bank Indonesia continued accelerating payment system digitalization and ensuring adequate currency in circulation for seamless, efficient and productive economic and financial transactions. Digitalization was implemented through innovation in various instruments and expansion of digital payment services, while strengthening the industry structure and the stability of payment system infrastructure, including integrating the national digital economy and finance ecosystem. To increase transaction value and the velocity of digital payments, Bank Indonesia in 2024 enhanced QRIS by expanding the user base and participating merchants, while extending the 0% merchant discount rate for micro merchants. The payment system structure was strengthened by expanding standard national open API payment (Bank Indonesia’s initiative to standardize and interconnect payment services through an open API framework) for greater interconnection of payment services and enhancing the surveillance of payment system providers, including monitoring for illegal transactions and strengthening cybersecurity. BI-FAST acceptance and stability were improved as retail payment system infrastructure that has become increasingly popular with the public. Similarly, the digitalization of social aid program (Bantuan Sosial – Bansos) disbursements and government financial transactions was expanded, particularly to accelerate and enhance local regional digitalization and increase acceptance of the Indonesia Credit Card for the government segment. Furthermore, Bank Indonesia also expanded cross-border payment cooperation through implementation of the Regional Payment Connectivity initiative in the ASEAN along with several other important economic partners of Indonesia.

From January 2025 to July 2025, Bank Indonesia reduced the BI Rate three times each by 25 bps. In January 2025, Bank Indonesia reduced the BI rate to 5.75%, while reducing the deposit facility rate and lending facility rate to 5.00% and 6.50%, respectively. In May 2025, Bank Indonesia reduced the BI rate to 5.50%, while reducing the deposit facility rate and lending facility rate to 4.75% and 6.25%, respectively. Bank Indonesia maintained the BI rate, the deposit facility rate and lending facility rate unchanged in February, March, April and June 2025.

In July 2025, Bank Indonesia reduced the BI rate to 5.25%, while reducing the deposit facility rate and lending facility rate to 4.50% and 6.00%, respectively.

The decision is consistent with the lower inflation projections for 2025 and 2026, which remain within the 2.5±1% target corridor, Rupiah exchange rate stability in line with economic fundamentals, and the need to support economic growth. Moving forward, Bank Indonesia will continue considering further room for interest rate reduction to nurture economic growth, while maintaining Rupiah exchange rate stability and orienting monetary policy towards managing inflation within the target corridor based on global and domestic economic dynamics. Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia continues optimizing accommodative macroprudential policy through strategies to increase credit and financing, lower interest rates and enhance liquidity management flexibility in the banking industry to support sustainable economic growth. Payment system policies are also oriented towards supporting economic growth by expanding digital payment acceptance, strengthening the infrastructure and consolidating the structure of the payment system industry.

Bank Indonesia has, therefore, strengthened its monetary, macroprudential and payment system policy mix to maintain stability in order to strengthen sustainable economic growth through the following policy measures:

 	1.
strengthening the Rupiah stabilization strategy in line with economic fundamentals, primarily through domestic foreign exchange market intervention with a focus on spot and domestic non-deliverable forward transactions as well as intervention in offshore non-deliverable forward transactions, while also purchasing SBN in the secondary market to maintain financial market stability;

 	2.
strengthening the pro-market monetary operations strategy to enhance monetary policy transmission effectiveness, maintain adequate liquidity, accelerate money market and foreign exchange market deepening and attract foreign capital inflows by:

 	a.
strengthening the effective transmission of lower interest rates by managing the interest rate structure of monetary instruments and forex swaps by attracting portfolio inflows to domestic financial assets,

 	b.
maintaining adequate liquidity in the money market and banking industry through SRBI auctions and purchasing SBN in the secondary market, and

 	c.
strengthening the function of primary dealers to increase SRBI transactions in the secondary market and repurchase agreement (“repo”) transactions between market players;

 	3.
strengthening prime lending rate publication transparency with a focus on interest rates based on priority sectors in accordance with the scope of macroprudential liquidity incentive policy (Kebijakan Insentif Likuiditas Makroprudensial);

 	4.
expanding digital acceptance by: (i) launching QRIS Cross-Border cooperation with Japan on and initiating the QRIS Cross-Border sandbox with China on August 17, 2025, and (ii) enhancing education and outreach of QRIS Tap, targeting users and merchants. QRIS Cross-Border is an initiative to enable QRIS payments for transactions between Indonesia and other countries. QRIS Tap is an initiative to apply QRIS in contactless payments; and

 	5.
strengthening and expanding international cooperation among central banks, including efforts to enhance payment system connectivity and facilitate local currency transactions, while promoting trade and investment in priority sectors in coordination with relevant institutions.

Bank Indonesia is also strengthening policy synergy with the Government to maintain stability and nurture economic growth in line with the Government’s Asta Cita program. In addition, Bank Indonesia will continue strengthening policy synergy with the Financial System Stability Committee (Komite Stabilitas Sistem Keuangan) to maintain the stability of the financial system.

Policy Synergy between Bank Indonesia and Ministry of Finance

In connection with the Republic’s legislative and regulatory response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia issued two joint decrees: (i) the first (“SKB I”), on April 16, 2020, provided for Bank Indonesia to act as backstop buyer in primary market auctions of Government securities from 2020 to 2022, pursuant to which Bank Indonesia purchased Rp75.9 trillion of Government securities in 2020, Rp143.3 trillion in 2021 and Rp49.1 trillion in 2022; and (ii) the second (“SKB II”), on July 7, 2020, related to the “burden sharing” between Bank Indonesia and the Ministry of Finance whereby, to help fund the Government’s Covid-19 relief and recovery efforts:

 	•
Rp397.5 trillion of Government expenditure in the public goods sector which includes health sector, social protection and labor-intensive programs, support sectoral and local government support is to be financed via Government securities privately placed to Bank Indonesia with a reference interest rate equal to the 3-month BI Reverse Repo Rate, to be borne entirely by Bank Indonesia; and

 	•
a substantial portion, or Rp177.0 trillion, of the total Rp505.9 trillion of Government expenditure in the non-public goods sector, which includes support to MSME and non-MSME corporates, is to be financed via Government securities issued via market mechanisms. The Government will bear the interest expense at a rate equal to the 3-month BI Reverse Repo Rate minus 1% and Bank Indonesia will bear the remaining interest expense necessary to match the market rate.

These initial burden sharing schemes were valid for 2020 and 2021 only. As part of their commitment to transparency to the public, the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia reported the realization of financing support under the joint decrees in their respective monthly press releases.

On August 23, 2021, the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia issued the third joint decree (“SKB III”) to cooperate on financing health and humanitarian care. Pursuant to the SKB III, the Government privately placed Government securities to Bank Indonesia, and the Government and Bank Indonesia coordinated to provide healthcare and humanitarian support in response to the Covid 19 pandemic. Specifically, Bank Indonesia contributed interest paid on the Government securities of Rp58 trillion in 2021 and Rp40 trillion in 2022 toward vaccination programs and other healthcare expenses and the Government contributed the remaining interest costs (at a variable interest rate equal to the three-month BI Reference Rate) of Rp157 trillion in 2021 and Rp184 trillion in 2022 toward healthcare expenses and humanitarian initiatives such protection programs for affected communities and small businesses.

SKB III concluded in December 2022 and no further joint initiatives have been pursued since, although the omnibus financial sector law passed in 2023 provides for additional coordination of fiscal policy of the Government and monetary policy of Bank Indonesia in the case of a future crisis declared by the President. See “—Financial System Financial Sector Omnibus Law (Law No. 4/2023)”.

Money Supply

Bank Indonesia tracks several different measures of money supply. Base money includes currency (bank notes and coins in circulation) and demand deposits of commercial banks and private sector at Bank Indonesia. Narrow money consists of currency outside the bank system plus Rupiah denominated demand deposits in commercial banks. Broad money consists of narrow money, securities other than shares, plus quasi-money, which includes time deposits and savings deposits in Rupiah and demand deposits in foreign currencies.

The following table sets forth the money supply as of the periods indicated.

As of December 31, 2020, broad money experienced faster growth on the back of narrow money (M1) and quasi-money. Totaling Rp6,905.9 trillion, broad money accelerated to 12.5% (year on year) compared to 6.5% (year on year) growth as of the end of the previous year. Narrow money growth increased to 14.9% (year on year) compared to 7.0% (year on year) as of the end of the previous year, in line with increases recorded in terms of currency outside banks and Rupiah demand deposits, as well as Rupiah saving deposits that can be withdrawn at any time. Further, quasi-money growth increased to 10.0% (year on year) compared to 5.8% (year on year) as of the end of the previous year, due to increases in all components, namely time deposits, other saving deposits and foreign currency demand deposits.

As of December 31, 2021, broad money grew by 14.0% (year-on-year) compared to 12.5% (year-on-year) as of the same date in the previous year, resulting from higher growth in narrow money. Narrow money growth increased to 17.9% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2021 compared to 14.9% (year-on-year) as of the same date in the previous year, due to higher growth in Rupiah demand deposits and Rupiah saving deposits that can be withdrawn at any time. Quasi-money growth decreased to 9.4% (year-on-year) compared to 10.0% (year-on-year) as of the same date in the previous year, due to slower growth in time deposits and other saving deposits.

As of December 31, 2022, broad money grew by 8.4% (year-on-year) compared to 14.0% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2021, due to a much slower growth of narrow money and quasi money. Narrow money grew slower by 9.5% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2022, compared to 17.9% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2021, due to slower growths of Rupiah demand deposits and Rupiah saving deposits. Quasi-money growth decreased to 6.8% (year-on-year) compared to 9.4% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2021, due to a slower growth in Rupiah time deposits.

As of December 31, 2023, broad money grew by 3.5% (year-on-year), compared to a growth of 8.4% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2022, due to slower growth of narrow money and quasi money. The much slower pace of broad money was primarily due to a growth of narrow money by 2.1% (year-on-year), compared to 9.5% (year-on-year) of robust growth as of December 31, 2022, due to decreasing Rupiah demand deposit. Quasi-money recorded a 5.3% growth (year-on-year) in December 2023, compared to a 6.8% increase (year-on-year) in December 2022. The slower growth of quasi money was primarily driven by slower growth pace of foreign currency demand deposits.

As of December 31, 2024, broad money grew by 4.8% (year-on-year) compared to 3.5% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2023, due to a higher increase in narrow money. Narrow money grew by 5.8% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2024 compared to 2.1% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2023, due to higher growth of Rupiah demand deposits and Rupiah saving deposits. Quasi money grew slower by 1.2% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2024 compared to 5.3% (year-on-year) as of December 31, 2023, due to a decrease in time deposits.

As of May 31, 2025, broad money grew by 4.9% (year-on-year) compared to 7.6% (year-on-year) as of May 31, 2024, due to a lower increase in quasi-money. Quasi-money grew by 1.5% (year-on-year) as of May 31, 2025 compared to 8.8% (year-on-year) as of May 31, 2024. Meanwhile, narrow money grew by the same rate at 6.3% as of May 31, 2025 and May 31, 2024.

Government Budget

Fiscal Policy

Since 2001, the focus of the Government’s fiscal policy has been to promote fiscal consolidation and reduce Government debt gradually in order to achieve fiscal sustainability. As a result of the overall macroeconomic situation and current policy challenges, since 2006, the Government has also focused fiscal policy on providing a modest degree of stimulus to the overall economy, within the constraints of the Government’s overall fiscal situation.

2024 Budget

On October 16, 2023, the Government promulgated Law No. 19 of 2023 on the State Budget for 2024. The state budget is directed at “Accelerating Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Transformation.” The state budget is aligned with the Government’s work plan for 2024, which has seven national priorities: (1) strengthening economic resilience for quality and equitable growth; (2) developing areas to reduce inequality and ensure equity; (3) increasing quality and competitiveness of human resources; (4) mental revolution and cultural development; (5) strengthening infrastructure to support economic development and basic services; (6) building the environment and improving disaster and climate change resilience; and (7) strengthening stability of politics, law, defense and security and transforming public service.

The key macroeconomic assumptions for 2024 underlying the 2024 Budget contained in the bill are as follows:

 	•
an economic growth rate of 5.2%;

 	•
an inflation rate of 2.8%;

 	•
an exchange rate of Rp15,000 to U.S.$1.00;

 	•
an average Government 10-year bond rate of 6.70%;

 	•
an ICP of U.S.$82 per barrel;

 	•
an oil production by the Republic of 635 thousand barrels of oil per day; and

 	•
gas production by the Republic of 1,033 million barrels of oil equivalent of gas per day.

Total revenue in the 2024 Budget is expected to be Rp2,802.3 trillion, or an increase of 13.8% from the 2023 Budget of Rp2,463.0 trillion. Total revenue comprises Rp2,309.9 trillion in tax revenues, Rp492.0 trillion in non-tax revenues and Rp0.4 trillion in grants.

Total expenditures under the 2024 Budget are estimated at Rp3,325.1 trillion, or 8.6% increase from the 2023 Budget of Rp3,061.2 trillion, comprising Rp2,467.5 trillion in central Government expenditures and Rp857.6 trillion in transfer to regions.

For 2024, the Government will continue to be committed to taking steps toward fiscal consolidation by maintaining a budget deficit below 3% of GDP. The primary deficit in the 2024 Budget is projected to be Rp522.8 trillion, or 2.29% of the projected 2024 GDP. The Government expects to fund the deficit through debt financing.

The 2024 Budget prioritizes inclusive and sustainable economic transformation by investing in human resources, social welfare, and infrastructure to boost productivity and competitiveness, reduce poverty, enhance social well-being, and promote equality. The 2024 Budget is based on and aligned with: (i) the Government’s 2024 tax policies that focus on the implementation of its new core tax administration system, technology-driven compliance and collaborative programs for effectiveness; (ii) the Government’s non-tax state revenue policies that aim to refine natural resource policies, optimize state-owned enterprise dividends, foster innovation and service quality in government agencies, improve synergy, expand information technology application, and strengthen oversight and compliance with international standards; and (iii) the Government’s financing policies that seek to achieve a positive primary balance, lower the negative balance caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, manage the budget deficit and debt financing and invest efficiently for economic transformation, and optimize the budget to mitigate global uncertainties.

The 2024 Budget aims to improve productivity and diversify the economy and achieve a clean and green environment. The Government’s fiscal policies target both short-term economic improvements and long-term structural reforms.

Review of the 2025 Budget

Presidential Instruction (Inpres) No. 1 of 2025, issued on January 22, 2025, directed members of the cabinet and other designated senior government officials to review the 2025 Budget in accordance with their respective duties, functions, and authorities to achieve budget efficiency. The presidential instruction highlighted a potential reduction of Rp306.7 trillion in government expenditure, including possible cuts of Rp256.1 trillion in the expenditures of central ministries and institutions, and Rp50.6 trillion in transfer to regions. The Government is reviewing the 2025 Budget following the presidential instruction and may revise the 2025 Budget.

On February 15, 2025, President Prabowo Subianto announced that the planned budget cuts would occur in three stages, extending beyond 2025 and aiming for total savings of Rp750 trillion.

In accordance with the presidential instruction, the Government is taking steps to (i) maximize revenue by implementing key strategies including enhancing tax compliance, expanding the tax base, leveraging data analytics for more accurate revenue forecasting, and implementing a technology-drive and effective revenue system; and (ii) refocus expenditure to accelerate priority programs by adopting measures including increasing efficiency in travel, seminars, office supplies and workshops, as well as prioritizing investments in human capital, job creation, productivity growth, food and energy security, and technological innovation.

As of June 24, 2025, a total of Rp134.9 trillion had been achieved in the release of budget blocks and reserves and the reallocation of expenditure efficiency gains, in accordance with President Prabowo Subianto’s directives to support national development priorities.

Changes to VAT; Stimulus Package

On December 31, 2024, President Prabowo Subianto announced that the previously-scheduled increase in VAT rates from 11% to 12% from January 1, 2025 applies only to goods and services already subject to luxury goods sales taxes (Pajak Penjualan Barang Mewah). Goods and services not classified as luxury items would remain subject to the VAT rate of 11% established in 2022. The 0% VAT exemption for essential goods and services remains in effect, covering basic necessities such as rice, meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fresh milk, educational services, healthcare services, public transportation services, affordable housing, and drinking water.

In December 2024, the Government introduced a stimulus package for 2025 with the budget amount of Rp38.6 trillion that includes, among other incentives:

Free Nutritious Meal Program

On January 6, 2025, the Government launched the Free Nutritious Meal Program to provide free meals to pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, toddlers, and students to fight malnutrition and stunting. The Government believes that the program will contribute meaningfully to GDP growth, employment generation and poverty reduction. According to the Head of the National Nutrition Agency, the program was initially allocated a budget of Rp71 trillion (approximately U.S.$4.3 billion) to serve an estimated 17.9 million beneficiaries throughout 2025. Following President Prabowo Subianto’s directive to accelerate the program’s scale-up, the Government now aims to reach 82.9 million beneficiaries by the end of 2025 through 32,000 active nutrition units (satuan pelayanan pemenuhan gizi, “SPPG”). To support this expansion, an additional budget of Rp100 trillion (approximately U.S.$6.2 billion) has been allocated, increasing the total 2025 budget for the program to Rp171 trillion (approximately U.S.$10.5 billion). As of June 30, 2025, there were approximately 5.59 million beneficiaries under the program, served by approximately 1,863 SPPG.

This includes establishing new Cooperatives in villages that currently lack them, enhancing the potential of existing Cooperatives, and ensuring that Cooperatives are better equipped to address the specific needs of each village. The instruction requires that budget allocation be prioritized and that acceleration strategies be incorporated into the work plans of ministries, institutions, and regional governments to achieve this goal. The Cooperatives are expected to provide a range of services such as basic goods procurement, savings and loans, clinics, pharmacies, and logistics, tailored to the unique needs and potential of each village or sub-district.

Economic Stimulus Packages to Maintain Economic Growth

On June 2, 2025, the Government officially launched an economic stimulus package worth Rp24.44 trillion (approximately U.S.$1.5 billion) for June and July 2025, aimed at maintaining and strengthening national economic growth and stability.

The stimulus package includes, among other things, (i) Rp11.93 trillion allocated for social assistance to 18.3 million beneficiaries, which includes monthly support of Rp200,000 per person under the Basic Food Card program and the provision of 10 kilograms of free rice per month for each beneficiary, (ii) Rp10.72 trillion allocated for wage subsidy, providing Rp300,000 per person per month to 17.3 million low-income workers and 565,000 non-tenured teachers, and (iii) Rp0.94 trillion allocated to subsidize mass transportation tickets, toll road tariff, and work accident insurance contribution.

Profits of the SOEs held by BPI Danantara are being transferred to BPI Danantara rather than the Government. See “Privatization and Management of State-Owned Enterprises -- BPI Danantara.”

Sources of Government Revenues.

The Government derives its revenues from both tax and non-tax sources. The main sources of tax revenues include income tax, value-added tax (“VAT”), customs duties and excises. The main sources of non-tax revenues are revenues generated from the sale of natural resources, profit transfers from SOEs and other non-tax revenues. Although oil and gas have historically been the single largest source of income tax and non-tax revenues for the Government, this has changed in recent years. In 2014, income tax from oil and gas as well as revenues generated from the sale of oil and gas constituted 16.0% and 54.4% of total income tax revenue and total non-tax revenues, respectively. In 2020, these ratios decreased to 5.6% and 20.6% respectively, primarily driven by a decrease in the average price of Indonesian crude oil and a decrease in oil and gas lifting.

Indonesian income tax comprises both corporate income tax and personal income tax. Starting from the fiscal year of 2020, the general corporate income tax rate is 22% applied to taxable profits. Listed companies that meet certain criteria are entitled to a reduction from the general rate (i.e., 3% lower); therefore the effective corporate income tax rate for listed companies is 19%. Small enterprises, being, corporate taxpayers with an annual gross turnover of up to Rp50 billion, are entitled to a 50% discount of the general income tax rate so that their effective tax rate will be 11%, to be imposed proportionally on taxable income of the part of gross turnover up to Rp4.8 billion. Certain enterprises with gross turnover of up to Rp4.8 billion are subject to a final income tax at 0.5% of revenue.

Personal income tax rates are set at progressive rates: (i) the maximum rate of 35% for annual taxable income above Rp5 billion, (ii) 30% for annual taxable income above Rp500 million and up to Rp5 billion, (iii) 25% for annual taxable income above Rp250 million and up to Rp500 million, (iv) 15% for annual taxable income above Rp60 million and up to Rp250 million, and (v) 5% for annual taxable income from Rp0 up to Rp60 million.

VAT is typically levied at a 11% rate on events involving the delivery of VAT-able goods or the provision of VAT-able services in the Indonesian customs area. The VAT rate was increased on January 1, 2025 to 12% only for goods and services already subject to luxury goods sales taxes (Pajak Penjualan Barang Mewah). Exports of VAT-able goods and certain VAT-able services are subject to a VAT rate of 0%. See “— Changes to VAT; Stimulus Package” for further information.

Customs duties consist of import duty and export duty. Import duty is applied on importation of goods and is payable at rates from 0% and 150% on cost, insurance and freight (“CIF”) level. Export of certain goods are subject to export duty on certain tariff based on the type of the products and calculated based on either certain percentage of customs value (ad valorem) or specifically based on duty rate/quantity in certain currency. Excises are generally imposed on certain goods, the distribution and consumption of which are required to be controlled due to their potential negative effects on society or the environment (such as ethyl alcohol and its concentrate, alcoholic drinks and tobacco products).

Other than the taxes described above, deliveries or imports of certain manufactured taxable goods may be subject to a sales tax on luxury goods, the rates of which by law may be increased up to 200%. These rates currently range between 10%—125%. Further, a property tax, called Land and Building Tax (Pajak Bumi dan Bangunan (“PBB”)), is chargeable on all land and/or buildings unless exempted. Previously, certain documents were subject to nominal stamp duty payable as a fixed amount of either Rp6,000 or Rp3,000. Since January 2021, the nominal stamp duty increased to a single fixed amount of Rp10,000. The Rp6,000 and Rp3,000 stamp duties apply until January 1, 2022 provided that at least Rp9,000 had been paid.

Government revenues realization decreased by 16.0% from Rp1,960.6 trillion in 2019 to Rp1,647.8 trillion in 2020, caused by reduced economic activities due to the Covid-19 pandemic and provision of tax incentives. By the end of 2020, total tax revenues decreased by 16.9% from Rp1,546.1 trillion in 2019 to Rp1,285.1 trillion in 2020, mainly driven by decreases in almost all tax revenues. Total non-tax revenues decreased by 15.9% from Rp409.0 trillion in 2019 to Rp343.8 trillion in 2020. This was mainly due to a decrease in the average price of Indonesian crude oil, measured by the ICP, and a decrease in oil and gas lifting, compared to the same period in 2019.

Government revenues realization increased by 22.1% from Rp1,647.8 trillion in 2020 to Rp2,011.3 trillion in 2021, driven by increases in domestic revenues. By the end of 2021, total tax revenues increased by 20.4% from Rp1,285.1 trillion in 2020 to Rp1,547.8 trillion in 2021, in line with improving economic activity and international trade. Total non-tax revenues increased by 33.4% from Rp343.8 trillion in 2020 to Rp458.5 trillion in 2021, in line with the upward trend in commodity prices, especially oil, minerals, coal, and crude palm oil.

Government revenues realization improved by a positive 31.0%, from Rp2,011.3 trillion in 2021, to Rp2,635.8 trillion in 2022, supported by rising commodity prices and maintained economic recovery. Total tax revenues increased by 31.5% from Rp1,547.8 trillion to Rp2,034.6 trillion, due to the increasing commodity prices, the expansive economic growth, and the implementation of Law No. 7 of 2021 on Harmonization on Tax Regulation. Total non-tax revenues increased by 29.9% from Rp458.5 trillion to Rp595.6 trillion, driven by significant increases in commodity prices and increases in the dividends of banking SOEs.

Government revenues realization improved by a positive 5.6%, from Rp2,635.8 trillion in 2022, to Rp2,783.9 trillion in 2023, representing 105.6% of the 2023 revised budget Government revenues. Tax revenues realization was Rp2,154.2 trillion and non-tax revenues realization was Rp612.5 trillion, representing 101.7% and 118.8% of the 2023 revised budget figures, respectively.

Government revenues realization improved by 2.1% from Rp2,783.9 trillion in 2023 to Rp2,842.5 trillion in 2024, representing 101.4% of the 2024 budget Government revenues. In 2024, tax revenues realization was Rp2,232.7 trillion or an increase of 3.6% from Rp2,154.2 trillion in 2023, and non-tax revenues realization was Rp579.5 trillion or a decrease of 5.4% from Rp612.5 trillion in 2023, representing 96.7% and 117.8% of the 2024 budget figures, respectively.

Government revenues realization decreased by 9.0% from Rp1,320.7 trillion in the first half of 2024 to Rp1,201.8 trillion in the first half of 2025, representing 40.0% of the 2025 budget Government revenues target. In the first half of 2025, tax revenues realization was Rp978.3 trillion or a decrease of 4.8% from Rp1,028.0 trillion in the first half of 2024, and non-tax revenues realization was Rp222.9 trillion or a decrease of 22.7% from Rp288.4 trillion in the first half of 2024, representing 39.3% and 43.4% of the 2025 budget figures, respectively. The decrease in non-tax revenues was driven by lower ICP, fluctuations in oil and gas lifting, and a drop in coal production relative to the prior period. Additionally, following the creation of BPI Danantara, profit from SOEs is now being transferred to BPI Danantara rather than the Government.

The tax-to-GDP ratio was in a relatively moderate range from 2017 to 2019, being 9.9% in 2017, 10.2% in 2018 and 9.8% in 2019. The tax-to-GDP ratio declined in 2020 to 8.3% due to the reduction of economic activity as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The tax-to-GDP ratio increased to 9.1% in 2021, 10.4% in 2022 and 10.3% in 2023 as a result of the recovery of economic activity. The tax-to-GDP ratio in 2024 was 10.1%.

Tax Amnesty

In July 2016, the Government passed Law No. 11 of 2016 on Tax Amnesty, which grants a certain tax amnesty to any individual or corporate taxpayer who met the requirements and submitted their application before March 31, 2017. 973,462 taxpayers participated in the program, which has concluded as of March 31, 2017.

As of March 31, 2017, Rp4,884.3 trillion in assets had been declared and the Government had collected Rp135.7 trillion as penalties under the scheme. Of the assets declared under the program, 75.8% are onshore, 21.2% are offshore and 3.0% have been repatriated (predominantly from Singapore). Most of the penalties collected, or Rp114.5 trillion of the total, as of March 31, 2017, represent “redemption” money, or the fee payable to the Government in exchange for the amnesty.

The Government hopes that the success of the tax amnesty program will continue to improve tax compliance in Indonesia. The submissions of annual tax reports by taxpayers who are required to submit one has generally risen, despite some fluctuation, in tandem with the general increase in the number of registered taxpayers in the past few years. The compliance rate for annual tax rate submissions was 77.6% in 2020, 84.0% in 2021, 83.2% in 2022, 88.0% in 2023 and 85.7% in 2024.

The Government has also been working to increase the number of registered taxpayers by unifying the identification number (Nomor Induk Kependudukan (“NIK”)) with the taxpayer identification number (Nomor Pokok Wajib Pajak (“NPWP”)). Previously, Indonesian individuals were required to register with the KPP to obtain an NPWP, which was a separate identification number from the NIK. However, starting from June 30, 2024, an individual’s NIK serves as his/her NPWP. This change is expected to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government’s taxation system.

Tax Incentive Policies

To drive investment, the Government’s tax incentives policy includes:

 	•
Tax holiday for certain “pioneer” industries, where eligible companies may be entitled to a 50% or 100% corporate income tax discount for a period of five to 20 years depending on the investment value, subsequent to which the eligible company may be entitled to a 25% or 50% income tax discount for an additional two years depending on the investment value;

 	•
Tax allowances to support investment in priority sectors, where the Government grants investment allowances of 30% from investment value (5% per year for six years) in addition to accelerated depreciation and amortization, dividend tariffs for foreign taxpayers of up to 10% or an amount according to the applicable tax treaty, and extended loss compensation beyond five years for a maximum period of 10 years;

 	•
Investment allowance for new investment in labor intensive sectors, where the Government grants investment allowance of 60% from investment value, spread throughout a certain period;

 	•
Super deduction for vocational activities conducted by industry, where government allows deduction to maximum 200% from all cost incurred;

 	•
Super deduction for research and development activities conducted in Indonesia, where government allows deduction to maximum 300% from all costs incurred for specific research and development;

 	•
VAT exemption on the supply of goods and services within free trade and free port zones, special economic zones and bonded warehouse areas (kawasan berikat); and

 	•
Income tax incentives in the capital city of Nusantara, including (1) tax holiday on investment in the capital city of Nusantara and partner areas; (2) tax holiday for the financial center of the capital city of Nusantara and withholding tax exemption for the foreign investors on the income arising from their investment in the financial center of the capital city of Nusantara; (3) tax holiday for the establishment and/or relocation of head office or regional office; (4) Article 21 income tax to be borne by the Government; (5) super tax deduction for research and development activities up to 350% of the costs incurred; (6) super tax deduction for vocational activities conducted by industry up to 250% of the costs incurred; (7) super tax deduction for donations and/or the cost of constructing public facilities, social facilities, and/or other non-profit facilities up to 200% of the costs incurred; (8) zero percent final income tax for MSME; and (9) exemption of income tax payable on the transfer of land and/or building rights.

Reform and Deregulation of Customs Taxation

The Government has been conducting reform and deregulation of customs taxation to support external trade. Key measures include, among other things:

 	•
Implementation of the Core Tax Administration System (“CORETAX”) starting from January 1, 2025, a unified platform that has integrated all the existing applications for tax filing, payment and administration;

 	•
Simplification of the tax refund process. Individual taxpayers with income tax overpayments of less than Rp100 million are now eligible to receive refunds without undergoing an audit;

 	•
Acceleration of tax audits. Effective February 14, 2025, the maximum audit period has been reduced from 12 months to six months. For group taxpayers and transfer pricing cases, the maximum audit period has been shortened from 24 months to ten months;

 	•
Customs valuation policy. The Government is using a price range system to improve the accuracy and speed of import document verification.

 	•
Import facilitation. The Government is reviewing and simplifying quota requirements and technical licensing for imports, and also improving licensing process through data-driven adjustments, making it easier for businesses to import goods and materials;

 	•
Simplification of import licensing and commercial processes. The Government is improving licensing processes through data-driven adjustments that align with supply and demand. Additionally, there is a shift in monitoring from border control to post-border oversight, with border inspections now limited to goods and materials that impact health, safety, security and the environment.

 	•
Implementation of AI-based HICO X-ray system. The Government is enhancing non-intrusive customs supervision at seaports and airports with the artificial intelligence-based system, which also improves the analysis of scanning results;

 	•
Building the National Logistic Ecosystem. This digitally integrated ecosystem across ministries has reduced logistics costs by streamlining, speeding up, and ensuring transparent processes. It currently covers 53 seaports and 7 airports; and

 	•
Other policies, including (i) harmonization of customs policies and administrative procedures for import and export activities to ensure alignment between upstream and downstream policies, while minimizing restitution; and (ii) improving processes related to trade protection policies to better support the competitiveness of businesses through trade remedies.

These measures collectively aim to create a more efficient, transparent, and business-friendly environment for external trade, supporting Indonesia’s competitiveness in the global market.

The basic price and retail price of certain types of fuel are set by the Government through the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources taking into consideration fuel purchasing cost, distribution cost, storage cost, and margin. Although the Government subsidy for fuel was eliminated in 2015, kerosene and gasoil continue to be subsidized by the Government. Historically, spending on subsidies has consumed a large portion of the Indonesian state budget. However, the Government in recent years has been implementing measures to raise subsidized fuel prices and reduce energy subsides by controlling the consumption of subsidized fuel through regulations, increased supervision and distribution management. In the past, fuel hike announcements have resulted in protests in major cities across Indonesia.

With recent global and domestic economic challenges, greater emphasis has been placed on improving national competitiveness. The Government is pursuing a more focused subsidy regime to provide direct subsidies to low-income households and to allocate a large part of the budget for infrastructure development. Following the adjustment of fuel subsidies, the Government has implemented a conditional cash transfer program for low- income households. “Smart cards” have been introduced to provide improved health care services, better facilities, education assistance and other kinds of social assistance.

The savings from reductions in fuel subsidies have been allocated to more productive Government spending. For example, energy subsidy spending was Rp108.8 trillion for 2020, Rp140.4 trillion for 2021, Rp171.9 trillion for 2022, Rp164.3 trillion for 2023 and Rp177.6 trillion for 2024. Budget energy subsidy for 2025 is Rp203.4 trillion. Spending for infrastructure was Rp286.5 trillion for 2020, Rp403.3 trillion for 2021, Rp372.8 trillion for 2022, Rp389.3 trillion for 2023 and Rp389.8 trillion for 2024. Budget infrastructure spending for 2025 is Rp399.3 trillion.

Government Expenditures

Total Government expenditures consist primarily of two components: (i) central Government expenditures and (ii) transfers to regions and rural fund. Central Government expenditures consist primarily of personnel, goods and services, capital, interest and social expenditures, as well as energy subsidies. Regional transfers consist primarily of expenditures for general and specific funds on the regional and rural level.

Total Government expenditure in 2020 reached Rp2,595.5 trillion or an increase of 12.4% from Rp2,309.3 trillion in 2019, in line with the countercyclical State Budget policy strategy adopted by the Government to withstand the impact of Covid-19 pandemic. Total central Government expenditure increased by 22.5% from Rp1,496.3 trillion in 2019 to Rp1,833.0 trillion in 2020. Total transfers to regions and rural fund decreased by 6.2% from Rp813.0 trillion in 2019 to Rp762.5 trillion in 2020 primarily due to lower general allocation funds realization, which also has lower budget allocation in the Revised 2020 Budget No. 2 compared to 2019.

Total Government expenditures in 2021 reached Rp2,786.4 trillion or an increase of 7.4% from Rp2,595.5 trillion in 2020. This is mainly driven by the realization of central Government expenditures, which, among other things, support the handling of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, especially in health sector and social protection. Total central Government expenditures increased by 9.1% from Rp1,833.0 trillion in 2020 to Rp2,000.7 trillion in 2021, primarily due to high expenditures from line ministries, which was mainly driven by the realization for infrastructure, connectivity projects, vaccination, medical treatment claims, productive relief programs, as well as disbursement of various protection programs. Total transfers to regions and rural fund increased by 3.0% from Rp762.5 trillion in 2020 to Rp785.7 trillion in 2021.

Total Government expenditures in 2022 reached Rp3,096.3 trillion or an increase of 11.1% from Rp2,786.4 trillion in 2021. This is primarily driven by the realization of central Government expenditures which increased by 14.0% from Rp2,000.7 trillion to Rp2,280.0 trillion. The increase was driven by line ministries and non-line ministries’ expenditures realization, which, among other things, supported the handling of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and economic growth and protected the populace. Total transfers to regions and rural fund increased by 3.9% from Rp785.7 trillion to Rp816.2 trillion.

Total Government expenditures in 2023 reached Rp3,121.2 billion or an increase of 0.8% from Rp3,096.3 trillion in 2022. This is primarily driven by the realization of transfer to regions and rural fund which increased by 8.0% from Rp816.2 trillion to Rp881.4 trillion, partially offset by the decrease of 1.8% in central Government expenditures from Rp2,280.0 trillion to Rp2,239.8 trillion.

Total Government expenditures in 2024 reached Rp3,350.3 trillion or an increase of 7.3% from Rp3,121.2 trillion in 2023, representing 100.8% of the 2024 budget Government expenditures. This was primarily driven by the realization of central government expenditures which increased by 11.0% from Rp2,239.8 trillion to Rp2,486.7 trillion, representing 100.8% of the 2024 budget figure, partially offset by the decrease of 2.0% in transfer to regions and rural fund from Rp881.4 trillion to Rp863.5 trillion, representing 100.7% of the 2024 budget figure.

Total Government expenditures in the first half of 2025 reached Rp1,406.0 trillion or an increase of 0.6% from Rp1,398.0 trillion in the first half of 2024, representing 38.8% of the 2025 budget Government expenditures. In the first half of 2025, central Government expenditures were Rp1,003.6 trillion or an increase of 0.6% from Rp997.9 trillion in the first half of 2024, representing 37.2% of the 2025 budget figure. In the first half of 2025, transfer to regions and rural funds reached Rp402.5 trillion or an increase of 0.6% from Rp400.1 trillion in the first half of 2024, representing 43.8% of the 2025 budget figure.

Public Debt

The reduction of public debt in percentage-of-GDP terms has been a consistent key fiscal policy objective of the Government. To achieve this objective, the Government’s policy has emphasized the strengthening of public debt management, the lengthening and balancing of the maturities of public debt and the growth of public debt at sustainable levels.

As of December 31, 2023, the central Government’s foreign debt-to-GDP ratio was 11.2%, with foreign debt to total debt ratio of 28.3%.

As of December 31, 2024, the central Government’s foreign debt-to-GDP ratio was 11.4%, with foreign debt to total debt ratio of 28.7%.

As of March 31, 2025, the central Government’s foreign debt-to-GDP ratio was 10.7%, with foreign debt to total debt ratio of 29.2%.

External Public Debt of the Republic

External public debt of the Republic consists of central Government debt (other than public domestic debt) and debt of Bank Indonesia owed to creditors outside Indonesia. The discussion below treats the external debt of Bank Indonesia as part of the Republic’s external debt. However, SBI and SRBI, which are issued by Bank Indonesia in its role as formulator and implementer of the Republic’s monetary policy, are not considered liabilities of the Republic. Accordingly, SBI and SRBI are not reflected in the Government debt discussions herein. See “— Financial System — Bank Indonesia.” The discussion of debt of the Republic in this section differs from the discussion of “Government debt” elsewhere in this report, in which Bank Indonesia debt is excluded and only central Government debt, which depends on Government revenue for its repayment, is included. See “— Government Budget — Government Finances.”

The following table sets forth information on the outstanding external public debt of the Republic in terms of creditor type as of the dates indicated.

Payment History of External Debt

Indonesia maintains a policy of external debt management and has a history of servicing its external debt obligations in accordance with its terms.

In the wake of the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the Paris Club, an informal voluntary group of 18 creditor countries that seeks to coordinate solutions for payment difficulties experienced by debtor nations by extending or guaranteeing bilateral credits, played an important role in easing Indonesia’s foreign exchange burden. Between 1998 and 2000, Indonesia twice rescheduled certain payments of its Paris Club foreign debt. Pursuant to an April 2002 agreement, Paris Club debt payments of principal and interest of approximately U.S.$5.4 billion that were due to certain of Indonesia’s creditors between April 2002 and December 2003 were rescheduled.

In addition, on March 10, 2005, the Paris Club offered to permit Indonesia, as well as other countries affected by the December 2004 tsunami, to defer debt services payments through the end of 2005 to allow these countries to commit additional government resources to the tsunami-related humanitarian and relief efforts. On May 10, 2005, 18 individual Paris Club members and Indonesia signed a memorandum of understanding to reschedule some payments of principal and interest due under official development assistance and non-official development assistance.

While there have been a number of reschedulings of Indonesia’s external debt to its bilateral creditors as described above, Indonesia has not defaulted on, and has not attempted to restructure, the payment of principal or interest on any of its external securities in the last 20 years.

External Debt of Bank Indonesia

Under Indonesian law, Bank Indonesia has the ability to incur external debt primarily to meet balance of payments needs and maintain adequate foreign exchange reserves.

Contingent Liabilities from Government Guarantees

As part of the Government’s policy to accelerate infrastructure development, the Government has provided support to encourage investments in infrastructure projects in the form of credit and investment guarantees. External debts of SOEs (or of BPI Danantara) are not direct obligations of the Republic, unless such debts are explicitly guaranteed by the Republic.

Beginning in 2008 the Government has allocated a contingent budget with respect to these guarantees. The allocated budget is then transferred to a guarantee reserve fund. This fund stands ready as reserves for any claims that may arise from the guarantees. Additional budget allocation can also be made available for direct payment of claims if necessary.

Total infrastructure guarantees provided by the Government between 2008 and 2024 have accumulated to Rp758.3 trillion, of which Rp390.7 trillion have expired, leaving active guarantees of Rp372.2 trillion as of December 31, 2024. No guarantee claim has materialized since the introduction of the Government’s guarantee programs. The Government has set a maximum guarantee limit of 1.5% of GDP per year for 2023-2026. However, the Ministry of Finance may re-evaluate the limit if it considers necessary.

As of December 31, 2024, the Government had provided infrastructure guarantees of Rp372.2 trillion, an increase from active guarantees of Rp345.0 trillion as of December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2024, the Government had accumulated Rp6.8 trillion in the guarantee reserve fund account.

The guarantee that the Government provided to infrastructure projects included:

 	•
full default risk guarantees relating to the PT PLN loans for the construction of coal power plants with aggregate capacity of 10,000 MW and the associated transmission lines (‘Fast Track I’ program). Outstanding guarantees for this program amounted to Rp0.6 trillion;

 	•
business viability guarantees to independent power producers on the ability of PT PLN to fulfill its financial obligations based on power purchase agreements related to the ‘Fast Track II’ program. The guarantee exposure for this program amounted to Rp64.4 trillion;

 	•
full default risk guarantees relating to the PT PLN loans for the construction of electricity infrastructure and business viability guarantees under 35 GW program. Outstanding guarantees for this program amounted to Rp91.3 trillion;

 	•
full default risk guarantees relating to direct lending from international financial institutions (multilateral and bilateral agencies) to SOEs for the construction of infrastructure projects. Outstanding guarantees for this program amounted to Rp49.7 trillion;

 	•
partial default risk guarantees for local government-owned water companies’ loans in connection with the Millennium Development Goals in water provision. Outstanding guarantees for this program amounted to Rp0.2 trillion;

 	•
co-guarantee scheme between the Government and the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund to guarantee private-public partnership projects such as power plant projects (e.g., the Central Java steam power plant) and several sections of toll road projects (e.g., Jakarta Cikampek II Elevated, Cileunyi — Sumedang — Dawunan, Krian — Legundi — Bunder — Manyar, Serang — Panimbang, Probolinggo — Banyuwangi, and Jakarta Cikampek II Selatan). The guarantee exposure for this program amounted to Rp108.8 trillion;

 	•
full default risk guarantees relating to PT Hutama Karya loans and bonds for the construction of Sumatera Toll Roads. Outstanding guarantees for this program amounted to Rp22.3 trillion;

 	•

 	•
guarantee for local infrastructure financing through PT SMI. Outstanding guarantees for this program amounted to Rp1.4 trillion.

As of March 31, 2025, the Government had provided infrastructure guarantees of Rp376.1 trillion, an increase from active guarantees of Rp372.2 trillion as of December 31, 2024.

As of March 31, 2025, the Government had accumulated Rp6.8 trillion in the guarantee reserve fund account.

Foreign Exchange and Reserves

Exchange Rates

From 1978 to 1997, Indonesia maintained a managed floating exchange rate system under which the Rupiah was linked to a basket of currencies, the composition of which was based on Indonesia’s main trading partners. Indonesia has adopted a free-floating exchange rate system since August 1997, under which market forces determine the exchange rate for the Rupiah. See “— Monetary Policy.”

For the information on historical exchange rates between the Rupiah and the U.S. dollar, see “Presentation of Information—Exchange Rates.”

Prudential Policies on Foreign Exchange and Rupiah

Under Law No. 24 of 1999 on Foreign Exchange Activities and Exchange Rate System, every resident may freely own and use foreign currency. Foreign currency is also generally freely transferable within or from Indonesia although by regulation most domestic transactions are prohibited from using foreign currency. Bank Indonesia has the authority to request information and data regarding foreign exchange activities and implement provisions regarding foreign exchange activities based on prudential principles.

To maintain the stability of the Rupiah, and to prevent the utilization of the Rupiah for speculative purposes by foreign parties, the Rupiah is non- internationalized. Regulations prohibit banks from conducting, among others, the following transactions: (i) extensions of loans or of overdrafts in Rupiah or foreign currencies to foreign parties, (ii) transfers of Rupiah to foreign parties or offshore banks in excess of U.S.$1 million without underlying transactions, and (iii) purchases of Rupiah-denominated securities issued by foreign parties.

Bank Indonesia has issued several regulations concerning foreign currency transactions relating to the Rupiah in order to deepen financial markets. A deep foreign exchange market is distinguished by adequate liquidity, convenient transactions, fair prices and minimal risk in order to maintain economic stability. Bank Indonesia strives towards the creation of a liquid, efficient and secure domestic foreign exchange market through amendments to regulations concerning foreign exchange transactions.

On January 1, 2015, Bank Indonesia regulations came into effect to mitigate risks relating to external borrowing by non-bank corporations. Under these regulations, corporate issuers of debt must, subject to certain limited exceptions:

 	•
hedge at least 25% of their open foreign exchange positions (i.e., the excess of foreign currency liabilities that fall due within the following three to six months over foreign currency assets);

 	•
maintain a 70% minimum liquidity ratio of foreign currency assets to foreign currency liabilities maturing within three months after the end of a quarter; and

 	•
maintain a minimum credit rating (issuer and/or issue) of BB- by a rating agency acknowledged by Bank Indonesia.

As of December 31, 2024, based on Bank Indonesia’s assessment of corporate issuers’ compliance with the regulations above:

 	•
89.0% of corporate issuers are compliant with the hedging ratio requirement for liabilities due under three months;

 	•
94.5% of corporate issuers are compliant with the hedging ratio requirement for liabilities due between three to six months; and

 	•
86.8% of corporate issuers are compliant with the liquidity ratio requirement for liabilities due under three months.]

Foreign reserves totaled U.S.$135.9 billion, U.S.$144.9 billion, U.S.$137.2 billion and U.S.$146.4 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, official international reserves position was U.S.$155.7 billion and U.S.$152.6 billion, respectively, equivalent to 6.5 and 6.2 months of imports and servicing government’s external debt, respectively. These are well above the international adequacy standard of around three months of imports.

Regional Swap Arrangements of the Republic

Following the experience of the Asian crisis in 1997 to 1998, ASEAN recognized a need to strengthen regional self-help and support mechanisms in East Asia and endeavored to prevent future financial crises. In 2000, ASEAN+3 members agreed to strengthen the existing cooperative frameworks among monetary authorities through the Chiang Mai Initiative (“CMI”). The CMI involves a network of BSAs among ASEAN+3 countries. The objectives of these bilateral swap arrangements are to address short-term liquidity difficulties in the region and to supplement existing international financial arrangements.

Since CMI’s inception in 2000, ASEAN+3 member countries undertook a review to explore ways of enhancing its effectiveness. On 2010, ASEAN+3 member countries entered into a multilateral currency swap contract which covers all ASEAN+3 member countries with a total size of U.S.$120 billion (the CMI Multilateralization or CMIM). CMIM was developed from the CMI-BSA network to facilitate prompt and simultaneous currency swap transactions through establishing a common decision making mechanism under a single contract. The CMIM objectives are the same as the BSAs. In May 2012 and in response to the global and regional economic developments, the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed to strengthen the CMIM as a regional financial safety net by doubling the total size to U.S.$240 billion and launching a crisis prevention program called the CMIM Precautionary Line (“CMIM-PL”). This arrangement became effective on July 17, 2014. On May 4, 2025, the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors agreed to amend the CMIM Agreement to introduce the Rapid Financing Facility (RFF) with the incorporation of eligible freely usable currencies as its currencies of choice under the CMIM. The amendment will take effect upon the completion of all necessary domestic procedures and the signing of the agreement by all participating authorities. In addition to the role of providing liquidity support for ASEAN+3 member countries, CMIM has contributed to the development of the regional surveillance capacity by establishing the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (“AMRO”), as an ASEAN+3 independent surveillance unit since early 2011.

Under the BSA, and CMIM, a total of U.S.$46.1 billion of foreign currency swap is currently available to the Republic. Up to 30.0% of the amount available under the BSAs and CMIM may be activated without participating in any IMF program, but greater amounts requires participation in an IMF program. The Republic also has a U.S.$22.8 billion bilateral swap line in place with Japan. These swap arrangements will contribute to greater financial stability and sustainable economic growth in the region.

On November 5, 2018, Bank Indonesia established a one-year bilateral financial arrangement with the Monetary Authority of Singapore with a size of up to U.S.$10.0 billion or equivalent (bilateral swap agreement and bilateral repo agreement). This bilateral financial arrangement enables the two central banks to access foreign currency liquidity from each other, if needed, to preserve monetary and financial stability. In November 2023, Bank Indonesia and the Monetary Authority of Singapore extended the bilateral financial arrangement by one year. This arrangement continues to reinforce the ongoing financial cooperation in preserving monetary and financial stability in both countries amid global macroeconomic uncertainties. The arrangement comprises two agreements: (1) A local currency bilateral swap agreement that allows for the exchange of local currencies between the two central banks of up to SGD9.5 billion or Rp100 trillion; (2) A bilateral repo agreement of U.S.$3 billion that allows for repurchase transactions between the two central banks to obtain USD cash using G3 government bonds as collateral.

On September 27, 2019, Bank Indonesia and Bank Negara Malaysia established a three-year local currency bilateral swap agreement with a size up to RM8 billion / Rp28 trillion, which will enable both central banks to access foreign currency liquidity from each other if needed. This arrangement was renewed on September 23, 2022 for three more years. Bank Indonesia and Bank Negara Malaysia have drawn on this local currency bilateral swap arrangement as part of their efforts to strengthen the cooperation in liquidity management between the two institutions, which is still continuing. Up to December 2024, there is no actual usage from these drawings.

In October 2021, Bank Indonesia renewed a bilateral swap agreement with Bank of Japan. The agreement enables Indonesia to swap IDR against the Japanese Yen or the U.S. dollar in an amount of up to U.S.$22.8 billion or equivalent.

In January 2022, Bank Indonesia renewed a three-year Bilateral Currency Swap Agreement (“BCSA”) with People’s Bank of China. The agreement allows exchanges of local currencies between the two central banks of up to CNY250 billion or Rp550 trillion (about U.S.$38.8 billion equivalent).

In February 2022, Bank Indonesia renewed a BCSA with the Reserve Bank of Australia. The agreement will span a period of three years and allow for the exchange of local currencies between the two central banks of up to A.U.$10 billion or Rp100.0 trillion.

In March 2023, Bank Indonesia has renewed a three-year BCSA, with the Republic of Korea amounting to KRW 10.7 trillion or Rp115 trillion.

In September 2024, Bank Indonesia and Bank Negara Malaysia renewed a local currency bilateral swap agreement, which was initially signed in September 2019 and first renewed in September 2022. This renewed agreement allows exchange of local currencies between the two central banks of up to RM24 billion or Rp82 trillion, for a period of five years.

In October 2024, Bank Indonesia and Bank of Japan renewed a bilateral swap arrangement, which enables Indonesia to swap Indonesian Rupiahs against the Japanese Yen or U.S. dollar in an amount up to U.S.$22.8 billion or equivalent.

In November 2024, Bank Indonesia and the Monetary Authority of Singapore renewed a bilateral financial arrangement to November 2027. The bilateral financial arrangement comprises a local currency bilateral swap agreement that allows exchange of local currencies between the two central banks of up to SGD9.5 billion or Rp100 trillion and a bilateral repo agreement of U.S.$3 billion that allows repurchase transactions between the two central banks to obtain USD cash using as collateral government bonds of the U.S., Japan and Germany.

In January 2025, Bank Indonesia and the People’s Bank of China renewed and strengthened their bilateral currency swap arrangement for a period of five years, which was initially signed in March 2009. This arrangement allows the two central banks to exchange their local currencies up to a value of CNY400 billion or the equivalent amount in Indonesian Rupiah, to further promote the bilateral trade and direct investment in local currencies and strengthen financial market stability.

In March 2025, Bank Indonesia and Reserve Bank of Australia renewed and strengthened their bilateral currency swap arrangement for a period of five years, to support trade and investment for the economic development of Australia and Indonesia and contribute to the financial stability of both countries. The arrangement enables the two central banks to exchange their local currencies up to a value of AUD10 billion or the equivalent amount in Indonesian Rupiah.
