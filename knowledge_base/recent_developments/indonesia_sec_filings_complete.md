# LAND AND PEOPLE

## Geography

Situated between Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south, the Republic of Indonesia covers a total land area of approximately 1,916,907 square km, comprising approximately 16,766 islands (the majority of which are uninhabited) and forming part of the world's largest archipelago.

### Major Islands

The main islands of Indonesia are:
- Sumatera
- Java
- Bali
- Kalimantan (also known as Borneo, the northern part of which belongs to Malaysia and Brunei)
- Sulawesi
- Papua (the eastern part of which belongs to Papua New Guinea)

Indonesia extends 5,120 km across the equator from Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam (Aceh) in the west to Papua in the east. Jakarta, Indonesia's capital and largest city, is located on the northern coast of the western part of Java.

## Volcanic and Other Natural Disasters

Indonesia is located in one of the most volcanically and seismically active regions in the world. Because it is located in the convergence zone of three major lithospheric plates, it is subject to significant seismic activity that can lead to:
- Destructive volcanic eruptions
- Earthquakes
- Tsunamis or tidal waves

### Historical Examples
- **2004 earthquake and subsequent Indian Ocean tsunami** devastated the Province of Aceh
- **2018 earthquake and subsequent tsunami** caused substantial loss of life and extensive infrastructure and property damage in Central Sulawesi

In addition to these geological events, Indonesia has also been struck by other natural disasters such as heavy rains and flooding.

### Contingency Fund for Natural Disasters

The central Government's realization of contingency fund for financing post-natural disaster relief efforts:
- 2020: Rp3.0 trillion
- 2021: Rp4.5 trillion
- 2022: Rp2.5 trillion
- 2023: Rp4.3 trillion
- 2024: Rp5.3 trillion

All of these natural disasters have resulted in loss of life, displacement of people and destruction of property, and could have significant economic and developmental effects.

## Environment

### Environmental Problems

Environmental problems confronting Indonesia include:
- Deforestation
- Scarcity and quality of the water supply
- Land subsidence
- Soil erosion
- Air pollution
- Inadequate waste management in urban centers
- Land and forest fires

### Climate Change Vulnerability

Indonesia is also vulnerable to the impact of global climate change such as:
- Prolonged droughts
- Increased frequency of extreme weather events
- Heavy rainfall resulting in floods

These impacts will affect:
- Production and distribution of food
- Water availability
- Energy resources in various provinces or regencies across Indonesia

Indonesia considers climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts as an integrated concept that is essential for building resilience in safeguarding food, water and energy resources.

### Climate Action Framework

Indonesia has adopted the National Action Plan and Presidential Regulation No. 98 of 2021 on the Implementation of Carbon Economic Value to achieve Nationally Determined Contribution targets and control over greenhouse gas emissions pertaining to national development.

The Government is making efforts, including multilateral cooperation, to achieve climate targets.

### Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP)

At the G20 meeting in Bali in November 2022, Indonesia and a number of developed economies including Canada, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom and the United States issued a joint statement to launch a Just Energy Transition Partnership ("JETP"), pursuant to which the developed economies committed to:
- Provide, mobilize and facilitate funding in the form of grants, low interest loans, and investment
- U.S.$10 billion expected from public sectors
- U.S.$10 billion expected from private investment

In November 2023, Indonesia released for public consultation a draft of the investment roadmap to mobilize the U.S.$20 billion committed under JETP and accelerate the country's transition toward clean energy.

### Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP)

Under the roadmap, known as the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan ("CIPP"), Indonesia is seeking to:
- Cut CO2 emissions from its on-grid power sector by 250 million tons by 2030
- Increase the portion of renewable energy in its power mix to 44% by 2030

CIPP outlines the need for U.S.$97.1 billion of further investment beyond the U.S.$20 billion committed under JETP, including:
- U.S.$66.9 billion for 400 clean energy project proposals to be started by 2030 at the latest

### Carbon Market Initiatives

As part of its efforts to achieve the climate goals, the Government launched an emissions trading system for the power generation sector in February 2023:
- Initially covered 99 coal-fired power plants
- Accounting for 81.4% of Indonesia's national power generation capacity
- Subject to Government-established emissions intensity targets

In September 2023, the Government also launched a carbon exchange, the Indonesia Carbon Exchange (IDX Carbon), operated by the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The IDX Carbon is designed to:
- Facilitate emissions trading
- Serve as a platform for future environmental commodities

### Carbon Tax Implementation

The Government is working on implementing carbon tax, with its legal basis established under Law No. 7 of 2021 on the Harmonization of Tax Regulations. Revenue generated from carbon tax will be allocated to:
- Finance climate mitigation and adaptation projects
- Support investment in clean technology and energy efficiency
- Support the ongoing global transition towards sustainable energy

### Economic Diversification Strategy

The anticipated future declines in demand for conventional sources of energy such as coal, oil, gas, and timber will present challenges to the Republic's sectors centered on these natural resources. The Government is proactively addressing these challenges by seeking to diversify the national economy and investing in sustainable energy sources through initiatives such as:

**1. Investment in emerging sectors**
The Republic is channeling investments into renewable energy sectors such as solar, wind and geothermal energy. For example, following the Government mandate stipulated in Indonesia's Law 3/2022 (as amended by Law No. 21 of 2023) and Presidential Regulation 63/2022, Nusantara must be powered by 100% renewable electricity and achieve net zero by 2045.

**2. Developing value-added industries**
The Republic has implemented policies to develop downstream manufacturing and refining industries that add value to the raw materials before export. This approach increases export value, creates jobs and stimulates domestic industrial growth.

**3. Expanding market access**
The Republic is pursuing trade agreements and strengthening trade partnerships to open new market opportunities for export, including export of products other than natural resources. The Republic is currently carrying out negotiations on several bilateral preferential or free trade agreements, such as the Indonesia-EU Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement.

**4. Infrastructure improvements**
Infrastructure development aims to:
- Enhance connectivity between different geographies
- Elevate economic productivity
- Drive urbanization
- Facilitate the movement of labor
- Foster equitable regional development
- Boost foreign and domestic investment

## Environmental Law Reform

The Law on Job Creation substantially revamped Indonesia's environmental law that was enacted in 2009 by virtue of Law No. 32 of 2009 on Environmental Protection and Management (as so amended, the "Environmental Law"). The Environmental Law is based on the concepts of:
- Sustainable development
- Prevention
- Precaution
- "Polluter pays" principle

It introduced environmental documentation and licensing requirements.

### Ministry Restructuring Under New Administration

Under the new administration of President Prabowo Subianto, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry has been restructured into two distinct ministries:

**1. Ministry of Environment**
- 2025 Allocated Budget: Rp1,079.8 billion (approximately U.S.$67.1 million)

**2. Ministry of Forestry**
- 2025 Allocated Budget: Rp5,158.5 billion (approximately U.S.$320.5 million)

### Budget Priorities

The budgets are focused on:
- Improving water quality
- Improving air quality
- Forest and land rehabilitation
- Mangrove rehabilitation
- Hazardous material and hazardous waste management
- Conservation forest management
- Domestic waste management
- Environmental law enforcement

### Jakarta Infrastructure Challenges and Solutions

In recent years, Jakarta has been plagued by frequent floods amid peaks in the rainy season given inadequate infrastructure and water management, resulting in the temporary relocation of tens of thousands of residents. Jakarta is also experiencing land subsidence issues primarily due to:
- Deep groundwater extraction
- Demand pressure from high-rise buildings in Jakarta

#### National Capital Integrated Coastal Development

To address this, the Ministry of Public Works and Housing introduced a National Capital Integrated Coastal Development master plan, under which:
- A giant seawall is proposed to be constructed in the north of Jakarta Bay
- Large lagoons will be built within the seawall to accommodate water flow from 13 rivers in Jakarta
- Project Status: Under construction
- Target Completion Date: 2030 (extended from initial target of 2025 due to unforeseen complexities such as the protracted land acquisition process)

#### Environmental Program

The Ministry of Public Works and Housing is collaborating with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry on an environmental program to:
- Build regional domestic waste infrastructure
- Develop domestic wastewater treatment
- Improve environmental quality

## Energy Security

### Government Initiatives

To enhance energy security, promote economic self-sufficiency, and support sustainable development, the Government is accelerating the development of biodiesel.

### B40 Biodiesel Mandate

Beginning in 2025, the Government started to implement its B40 biodiesel mandate, which requires:
- 40% blend of palm oil-based fuel with 60% diesel
- Target to increase this blend to 50% by 2027

### Financial Support for Biodiesel

To facilitate the implementation of biodiesel, the Government is providing financial support:
- Projected annual biodiesel incentive: Rp35.8 trillion
- Projected annual biodiesel subsidy and compensation: Rp51.4 trillion (from 2025 to 2029)

### Electricity Generation and Renewable Energy

The Government is encouraging private sector participation in the development of the upstream electricity ecosystem, which encompasses:
- Electricity generation
- Transmission

This sector has traditionally been dominated by SOEs, but the Government believes that greater private sector involvement is key to satisfy the country's electrification investment needs.

### Renewable Energy Targets

The Government has set targets for renewable energy:
- 19% of Indonesia's power generation by 2029
- 23% by 2034

### Investment Requirements for Renewable Energy

The required investments for achieving these targets are estimated at:
