# Bank Indonesia (BI) Policy Framework

## Current Policy Rate (December 2025)
- BI Rate: 5.75% (as of latest decision)
- Policy stance: Accommodative with data dependency
- Next review: January 22, 2026

## Key Policy Principles
1. Inflation targeting: 2-4% (midpoint 3%)
2. Exchange rate stability: Monitor USD/IDR (target 15,000-15,500 range)
3. Financial stability: Monitor credit growth and banking system health

## Market Implications
- Rate hikes likely pause if inflation stabilizes
- Rupiah strength expected if foreign capital inflows continue
- Bond yield compression possible in recovery scenario

## Historical Context
- BI raised rates from 3.0% to 5.75% in 2023-2024
- Inflation peaked at 5.93% in September 2023, now cooling
- Expectations: Rates may start declining in 2026 if inflation remains controlled
